Predictive factors for surgical site infection in general surgery  Manjunath Haridas, MD, and Mark A. Malangoni, MD, Cleveland, Ohio  Background. Global parameters, such as wound class, the American Society of AnesthesiologistsÕ physical classiﬁcation score, and prolonged operative time, have been associated with the risk of surgical site infection (SSI). We hypothesized that additional risk factors for SSI would be identiﬁed by controlling for these parameters and that deep and organ/space SSI may have different risk factors for occurrence. Methods. A retrospective review was performed on general and vascular surgical patients who underwent an operation between June 2000 and June 2006 at a single institution. Patients with SSI were matched with a case-control cohort of patients without infection (no SSI) according to age, sex, ASA score, wound class, and type of operative procedure. Data were analyzed using bivariate and regression analyses. Results. Overall, 10,253 general surgical procedures were performed during the 6-year period; 316 patients (3.1%) developed SSI. In all, 300 patients with 251 superﬁcial (83.6%), 22 deep (7.3%), and 27 organ/space (9%) SSIs were matched for comparison. Multivariate logistic regression analysis identiﬁed previous operation (odds ratio [OR], 2.4; 95% conﬁdence interval [CI] = 1.6--3.7), duration of operation $75th percentile (OR, 1.8; 95% CI = 1.2--2.8), hypoalbuminemia (OR, 1.8; 95% CI = 1.1--2.8), and a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OR, 1.7; 95% CI = 1.0--2.8) as independent risk factors for SSI. Only hypoalbuminemia (OR, 2.9; 95% CI = 1.4--6.3) and a previous operation (OR, 2.0; 95% CI = 1.0--4.4) were signiﬁcantly associated with deep or organ/space infections. Conclusions. These results demonstrate additional factors that increase the risk of developing SSI. Deep and organ/space infections have a different risk proﬁle. This information should guide clinicians in their assessment of SSI risk and should identify targets for intervention to decrease the incidence of SSI. (Surgery 2008;144:496-503.)  From the Department of Surgery, Case Western Reserve School of Medicine, MetroHealth Medical Center, Cleveland, Ohio  SURGICAL SITE INFECTION (SSI) is 1 of the most com- mon complications after an operation, and it has been reported to vary between 2.1% and 7%.1 These infections result in an increase in morbidity, duration of hospital stay, health-care expenses, and mortality.2-4 Current efforts are underway to de- crease SSI by implementing process measures that have been demonstrated to decrease the risk of SSI.2,5,6 Compliance with these process mea- sures, however, has not been associated consis- tently with a reduction in SSI.7,8 Therefore,  Presented at the 65th Annual Meeting of the Central Surgical Association, Cincinnati, Ohio, March 6–8, 2008.

The National Nosocomial  Infection Surveil- lance (NNIS) study identiﬁed wound class, Amer- ican Society of AnesthesiologistsÕ (ASA) physical classiﬁcation score, and prolonged operative time as parameters associated with risk of developing SSI.9 Within each deﬁned parameter is a range of risk that likely is inﬂuenced by other factors that may be possible to modify through dedicated intervention.  Identifying factors that inﬂuence SSI risk has the potential to help direct resources to decrease the incidence of SSI. We hypothesized that addi- tional risk factors for SSI would be identiﬁed by comparing patients with SSI with a matched case- control cohort of patients without SSI to control for known risk factors, such as wound class, ASA risk score, and type of operative procedure. We also investigated whether deep and organ/space  Surgery Volume 144, Number 4  Haridas and Malangoni 497  infections, which have a greater morbidity and mortality than superﬁcial SSI, had a different risk proﬁle. Additional parameters were identiﬁed that are potential targets for future interventions.  METHODS  Patients 18 years of age or older who underwent a general or a vascular surgical operation between June 2000 and June 2006 at MetroHealth Medical Center, which is a public tertiary care and teaching hospital, comprised the study population. SSI was identiﬁed by a search of the medical records database using ICD-9 codes. Patients who devel- oped SSI had their medical records reviewed retrospectively. SSI was categorized based on stan- dard deﬁnitions.8 Superﬁcial infection was deﬁned as an infection of the surgical site that occurred within 30 days after the operation and involved the skin or subcutaneous tissue. Deep infection was deﬁned as infection of the surgical site that oc- curred within 30 days after operation and involved the fascial and muscle layers. Organ/space infec- tion was deﬁned when an SSI that occurred within 30 days after operation involved any part of the anatomy (eg, organs or spaces) beneath the incision.8  In all, 50 discrete variables were assessed, which included demographics, comorbid diseases, pre- operative and intraoperative variables, the type of operative procedure, and information regarding the SSI. Comorbid diseases were determined to be present when such a diagnosis was present in the medical record at the time of the index operation. Data regarding previous operations and the use of prior incision site for the current operation were collected. Intraoperative data were collected from the operating room information system (Surgical Information Systems, Alpharetta, Ga). This infor- mation included ASA risk score, wound classiﬁca- tion, and estimated operative blood loss. Operations were categorized into 5 discrete groups for comparison. Operations that exceeded the referenced 75th percentile for that procedure were considered prolonged.  type and duration of operation,  We developed a reference group of patients without SSI (No SSI) for comparison This case- control cohort was created by matching a patient with SSI to the next patient in the database without an SSI using the following variables: age ± 5 years, sex, ASA risk score, wound class, and type of operation. Patients who could not be matched (n = 16) were excluded from additional analysis. Some continuous variables were catego- rized for comparison (eg, hemoglobin # 10 g/dL,  serum albumin # 3.4 mg/dL, and estimated blood loss $ 500 mL); continuous data are presented as mean ± SD.  Data were analyzed using SPSS statistical soft- ware (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Ill). Discrete variables were compared using chi-square analysis or the Fisher exact test. Continuous variables were com- pared using an unpaired, 2-tailed Student t-test. Differences were considered signiﬁcant at P less than or equal to .05. Variables with a P value of less than or equal to .10 on bivariate analysis were retained for multivariate analysis using a backward stepwise logistic regression model to predict the risk of developing SSI. This study was approved by the MetroHealth Medical Center Institutional Re- view Board.  RESULTS  In all, 10,253 general and vascular operations were performed over 60 months. Of those, 5,929 ambulatory operations were performed, which included patients who stayed less than 24 h (57.8%), 2919 inpatient procedures (28.5%), and 1,405 operations on patients who were admitted the same day (13.7%). The average ASA score for these patients was 2.6 ± 0.9. Operations were most commonly classiﬁed as clean (n = 6,395, 62.4%) or clean-contaminated (n = 2,224, 21.7%).  In all, 300 patients met the inclusion criteria for SSI and were matched adequately for comparison. The mean age for SSI patients was 56.3 ± 14.3 years. In all, 193 women and 107 men participated in this study. The demographic and patient char- acteristics of this group are listed in Table I. In all, 251 patients (83.6%) developed superﬁcial SSI, 22 patients (7.3%) had deep SSI, and 27 patients (9%) had organ/space infection. SSI was more common in patients with ASA 2 and 3 risk scores (38% and 50%, respectively) and those with clean and clean-contaminated wound class (62% and 28%, respectively; Table II). The mean ASA score for all SSI patients was 2.6 ± 0.7. Patients who de- veloped deep and organ/space infection (n = 49) had a greater mean ASA score (3.0 ± 0.7) than pa- tients with superﬁcial SSI (P < .002) and were less likely to have a clean wound class (32.7% vs 67.7% with superﬁcial SSI, P < .001). Deep and organ space SSI was more commonly present among pa- tients who operations (71.4%).

Hypoalbuminemia, a low hemoglobin, excessive alcohol use, and his- tory of a previous operation were identiﬁed as sig- niﬁcant risk factors associated with developing deep and organ/space SSI (Table V).  Multivariate logistic regression analysis identiﬁed a history of previous operation (odds ratio [OR], 2.4; 95% conﬁdence interval [CI] = 1.6--3.7), pro- longed operative time (OR, 1.8; 95% CI = 1.2--2.8), hypoalbuminemia (OR, 1.8; 95% CI = 1.1--2.8), and  history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OR, 1.7; 95% CI = 1.0--2.8) was signiﬁcantly associ- ated with the development of SSI. Multivariate analysis identiﬁed hypoalbuminemia (OR, 2.9; 95% CI = 1.4--6.3) and history of previous operation (OR, 2.0; 95% CI = 1.0--4.4) as risk factors for deep and organ/space infection.  DISCUSSION  The NNIS study has identiﬁed 3 risk factors--- ASA score, wound class, and prolonged operative time---as predictive of the development of SSI.1 Considerable variability, however, exists in the rate of SSI when using this predictive model.10,11 Recent studies have indicated that the NNIS risk index is not sufﬁciently accurate and may need to be modiﬁed.9,10,12 This observation prompted us to evaluate a large population of general and vascular surgical patients at a single institution for additional risk factors that could be targeted to prevent SSI.  Our results identiﬁed the history of a previous operation, prolonged operative time, hypoalbumi- nemia, and a history of chronic obstructive pul- monary disease as major risk factors that affect the development of SSI when we corrected for ASA score, wound classiﬁcation, and type of procedure. Other factors found to be signiﬁcant on bivariate analysis included a history of congestive cardiac failure, excessive alcohol use, operation through a previous incision, infection at a remote site, and a low preoperative hemoglobin.  Recent studies have identiﬁed history of a pre- vious operation as a risk factor for SSI among patients who underwent colorectal operations.13,14 Gastrointestinal procedures comprised the most common type of procedure performed in our pa- tients. Half of the patients in the current study had a history of previous operation, and 64% of these patients had their operation performed through a previous incision site. In our study, 74% of patients who developed more complicated SSI (deep and organ/space infection) had a gas- trointestinal operation, and 71% of these opera- tions involved the large bowel. A previous operation may serve as a surrogate for a more dif- ﬁcult operation, which can also be associated with prolonged operative time. This observation can af- fect wound class particularly if contamination oc- curs during the procedure. Conducting the operation through a previous incision may predis- pose to SSI because the scar has decreased vascu- larity and may be affected by previous incisional complications (although we did not examine this parameter). One strategy to reduce SSI may be to  Surgery Volume 144, Number 4  Haridas and Malangoni 499  Table II.

Previous studies have assessed the inﬂuence of prolonged operative time as a risk factor for SSI.15 Prolonged operative time may be an indicator of more advanced disease, reoperative operation, or difﬁculties encountered intraoperatively. Opera- tive time is often related to increased blood loss, which can contribute to tissue hypoxemia. A long operation also exposes the incision to desic- cation, which may increase the likelihood of inci- sional contamination. The use of a laparoscopic approach has been demonstrated to decrease the incidence of SSI signiﬁcantly after cholecystec- tomy and colon resection.9,16 Unfortunately, mini- mally invasive approaches may not be possible in all situations. Although the incidence of superﬁ- cial SSI has been decreased by the use of mini- mally invasive approaches, the incidence of deep and organ/space infection remains unchanged.17 This observation implies that other parameters also inﬂuence the development of deep and organ/space infections.  Hypoalbuminemia can be associated with hepa- tic dysfunction, protein-calorie malnutrition, and  cancers  frequently  tract  an active acute-phase response. A low serum albu- min concentration was found in 24% of patients with superﬁcial SSI and in 51% of those with deep and organ/space infections. A large study from the National Surgical Quality Improvement Project has demonstrated that low serum albumin is associated with an increased risk of SSI in patients who undergo general and vascular surgical opera- tions.18 Patients with oropharyngeal or upper gas- trointestinal have hypoalbuminemia; preoperative correction of hy- poalbuminemia using supplemental nutrition im- proves mortality and reduces postoperative complications.19 In contrast, correction of hypoal- buminemia using supplemental intravenous albu- min does not improve mortality in critically ill patients.20 The strategy of using supplemental al- bumin prior to operation has not been tested spe- ciﬁcally as a perioperative maneuver to decrease SSI. Selective patients who require major elective procedures may beneﬁt from attempts to improve their nutritional operative intervention.  status prior  to  Multivariate analysis identiﬁed chronic obstruc- another  tive pulmonary disease (COPD) as  500 Haridas and Malangoni  Surgery October 2008  Table III.

Patients with COPD have lower tissue oxygen delivery and decreased physiologic reserve. Oxida- tive-mediated mechanisms for microbial killing are compromised profoundly, and tissue oxygenation is impaired.21 The absence of an effect of COPD on the incidence of deep and organ/space SSI sug- gests that additional risk factors, such as wound class and ASA score, may be more important for the development of these complications.  Deep and organ/space SSI is associated with a greater mortality than superﬁcial infection. Like superﬁcial SSI, hypoalbuminemia and a previous operation signiﬁcantly increased the risk of deep and organ/space SSI. Patients who developed these infections were older, had a greater ASA risk score, and were more likely to have microbial contamination of the incision during operation. The persistence of hypoalbuminemia and a prior operation as risk factors in these patients suggests that they are exceedingly important factors that impact the development of all types of SSI. The lack of signiﬁcance of a prolonged operative time and COPD in patients with deep and organ/space SSIs could also be because of the smaller sample size in this group.  Our study has several limitations. It was retro- spective and had a relatively small sample size, particularly in the subset of patients with deep and organ/space SSI. We did not collect data on other measures demonstrated to affect the incidence of SSI, such as the use of perioperative antimicrobial prophylaxis, method and timing of hair removal, skin preparation, and the adequacy of mechanical bowel preparation.22-24 Although we abide by the current recommendations for these measures rou- tinely, it is possible that our results were affected by individual or system errors. We also did not rou- tinely collect measurements of patient body tem- perature, glycemic control, oxygenation, or the use of intraoperative transfusions. We attempted to minimize the confounding effects of these vari- ables by using a matched case-control cohort. Data regarding the microbiology of the SSI were not ex- amined, and it is possible that recently reported  Surgery Volume 144, Number 4  Haridas and Malangoni 501  increases in antimicrobial resistance may have re- duced the effectiveness of standard perioperative antimicrobials.  The results of this study suggest that preopera- tive risk factors in addition to those traditionally associated with SSI can be identiﬁed and are important to recognize. Deep and organ/space infections have a different risk proﬁle. This infor- mation should guide clinicians in their assessment of SSI risk and should identify other targets for intervention to decrease the incidence of SSI. Additional research to assess the validity of these observations is needed to determine their relative importance and to assess the effectiveness of pro- posed interventions.  REFERENCES  1.

It is one of many I think we will see that shows the extreme power of contemporary data schemes that allow you to make comparisons that you just couldn’t have done by hand before. There is much also to value in this paper because it talked about deep wound infections and intraspace infection that is excluded from most pa- pers. And while the numbers are small here, it is a really good part of this.  The problem with COPD is it  is a variable for somebody that has mild forms, severe forms. You can imagine that is a continuous variable and you need to account for that.  502 Haridas and Malangoni  Surgery October 2008  Given all the publicity that NSQIP has used about an albumen of 2.0, I think the observation that an albumin of 3.8 is a cut point for this group of people is really, really important, so we don’t have to go to the extremes that the V.A. has talked about, we can examine now lesser degrees of hypoalbumin and realize they are highly signiﬁcant.  I do have a question of Dr Malangoni. How did you follow the discharge data? How did you get the post-op infections that occurred in these people? Are you sure you got them all? That has been the will of the wisp for the short term hospitalization now for about 15 years, and ﬁnding that out from the doctors’ records is really important.  I found the deep versus superﬁcial infection a really low hemoglobin,  intriguing inquiry---again, albumin, alcohol, pre-op through the same incision.  I think that also sets up a little bit of the suggestion made last year about an apgar score for surgery after an operation is done. We are pretty good with the preop- erative surgical time-out. I think the post-op surgical brieﬁng to reassess where you have been and say we did lose more blood, did it last longer than expected, maybe we had better keep a closer eye on this patient is a big part of it. And I would encourage you, Dr Malangoni, to go ahead and perhaps try some of the bigger, even more robust databases to see if these points are conﬁrmed. I bet they are. And I particularly think the data about the deep wound infection is really new and not previously known.  Dr Mark A. Malangoni (Cleveland, Ohio): Dr Polk, thank you for your comments. I think your question about following the postoperative course of the opera- tions is extremely important. We only follow these infec- tions out to 30 days, as does the CDC, so we did not follow any prosthetic-related infections that might occur beyond 30 days. But we did use our electronic medical record which incorporates outpatient visits to allow us to follow these patients for that period of time. I appre- ciate your comments about the need for using large da- tabases to conﬁrm or refute what information we have found on our small database, and we hope to be able to do that in the future.  Dr William G. Cheadle (Louisville, Ky): I congratu- late both Drs Haridas and Malangoni on a very interest- ing and comprehensive study of a single institutional experience identifying these risk factors. You found that previous or long operation, low albumin, and COPD out of 50 discreet variables were signiﬁcantly asso- ciated with SSI, and this occurred even when you con- trolled for ASA class, wound classiﬁcation, and the type of procedure.  Your overall SSI rate of 3% including 10,000 patients over six years is certainly laudable, although your use of ICD-9 codes in a retrospective fashion likely underesti- mates superﬁcial incision SSI, but not certainly necrotiz- ing fasciitis or deep tissue space infection. Identiﬁcation of these additional risk factors that are amenable to risk reduction certainly will be helpful to us all and especially  the hospital bottom line as the era of no pay for these complications is ushered in.  I have a few questions to clarify the patient groups. How many of these were performed through minimal access methods and what was the rate of SSI in these particular cases?  Secondly, have you noticed a change in the microbi- ology and seen more MRSA? I know you didn’t really study them in the paper, but I am sure you have got an intuition on that factor.  Length of operation is likely a surrogate for both complexity and blood loss and do you think we ought to be using a longer-acting antibiotic because redosing clearly is going to be an issue in these patients if we don’t remember to do so.  The reoperative ﬁnding of a higher SSI rate in incisions made through old scars is certainly interesting and I wonder if that related in particular to groin incisions in reoperative vascular surgery where that has clearly been shown to be the case.  I want to congratulate you on this great study. I think some of these measures clearly are amenable to correc- tions such as malnutrition and COPD and I wonder if these are going to be added to the list that is sponsored by CMI.  Dr Mark A. Malangoni (Cleveland, Ohio): We did not break out our laparoscopic cases per se to look at the in- fection rate in those cases. But what we did do in our matching process is match patients that had minimally invasive approaches with a minimally invasive approach on the other side. So as good as that is, that is what our data really reﬂect.  One of the things about laparoscopic surgery is while it has decreased the incidence of superﬁcial surgical site infections it has not had an effect on deep organ space infections, which suggests that there are really a different set of factors that inﬂuence those different types of infections. And indeed that was one of the important things that we observed in our study and I think something that all of us are going to have to look at more vigorously in the future.  The redosing issue, I think, is extremely important. And whether that turns out to be a longer antibiotic or making certain we redose at the proper time, I think those are two different strategies that can be used to make certain that we have the right amount of drug on board at the time that the incision is at risk. I think the key there is to have surgeons involved in what really is now a multi-disciplinary approach with our anesthesiol- ogists, the nurses, the pharmacists, et cetera, in making certain that those things happen on time, or we take other measures to make sure that all of those things are done.  Dr Jay L. Grosfeld (Indianapolis, Ind): One of the things over the years that I have always been concerned about is reoperating through a previous wound, and you have alluded to that being a factor. However, what you didn’t tell us is how many of those previous wounds have had an infection. Because if you operate through  Surgery Volume 144, Number 4  Haridas and Malangoni 503  a previous wound that has been previously infected, I am sure that the infection rate must be much higher. And I wonder whether you sought to try to elucidate between clean and dirty wounds the ﬁrst time around and then going back to the same wound. What is the outcome?  Dr Mark A. Malangoni (Cleveland, Ohio): That is an important observation, and that is another limitation of our study. While we did record when a previous incision was used, we did not record when that incision had been infected previously. I would absolutely agree with your observations, however, avoiding that incision when it has previously been infected is an absolute key to staying out of trouble. Because certainly I think all of us would have that experience that once infected, when that inci- sion is traversed again, it is certainly much more likely to be infected the second time.  Dr Thomas A. Stellato (Cleveland, Ohio): Dr Malan- goni, congratulations on an important paper. You men- tioned diabetes. But I wonder, do you have any information about the adequacy of control of the dia- betes at the time of surgery, both preoperatively, intra- operatively, and perioperatively? Did patients have glucoses below 200 at the time they underwent sur- gery? And the second issue is body mass index. Did you have any information about the signiﬁcance or lack of signiﬁcance of obesity and morbid obesity in these patients?  Dr Mark A. Malangoni (Cleveland, Ohio): We did not track obesity as a risk factor in this particular patient group. And I think that is because the prevalence of that problem is so high. But nonetheless, we didn’t track  it. We also don’t have information about how well con- trolled our diabetics were, either by a measurement of hemoglobin A1C as an idea of how well they are con- trolled chronically before the operation, nor did we track the data about glycemic control after the opera- tion. So we do not have that information.  Dr Patrick Vaccaro (Columbus, Ohio): I have a ques- tion about groin infections in vascular cases. Were you able to break that out from the other elective vascular cases and were you able to look at whether or not they had concurrent lesions on their extremities while you were operating on those people with ulcerations or actu- ally foot their vascular procedure?  infections at  the time of  Dr Mark A. Malangoni (Cleveland, Ohio): Again, we used our case control matching system in order to have like patients in both groups. So while we did not track infection at a particular incision site, we matched patients by identical procedures. So if a patient had a groin incision as part a vascular operation in the infected group, then we tried to match that patient who had a similar operation with a groin incision in the case con- trol group. But otherwise, we don’t have any more infor- mation. We did look at whether or not there were any skin rashes or lesions around the site of the incision or the area being prepped. We did not look at the presence of skin lesions at other sites, for instance on the same ex- tremity, unless they were infected. So 14% of our pa- tients had infection in remote sites. But again, I don’t have the detail about how many of those were on an ex- tremity in the particular circumstance you addressed.  Prioritizing Quality Improvement in General Surgery  Peter L Schilling, MD, Justin B Dimick, MD, MPH, John D Birkmeyer, MD, FACS  BACKGROUND: Despite growing interest in quality improvement, uncertainty remains about which procedures offer the most room for improvement in general surgery. In this context, we sought to describe the relative contribution of different procedures to overall morbidity, mortality, and excess length of stay in general surgery.  RESULTS:  STUDY DESIGN: Using data from the American College of Surgeons’ National Surgery Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP), we identified all patients undergoing a general surgery procedure in 2005 and 2006 (n ⫽ 129,233). Patients were placed in 36 distinct procedure groups based on Current Procedural Terminology codes. We first examined procedure groups according to their relative contribution to overall morbidity and mortality. We then assessed procedure groups according to their contribution to overall excess length of stay. Ten procedure groups alone accounted for 62% of complications and 54% of excess hospital days. Colectomy accounted for the greatest share of adverse events, followed by small intestine resection, inpatient cholecystectomy, and ventral hernia repair. In contrast, several common procedures contributed little to overall morbidity and mortality. For example, outpatient cho- lecystectomy, breast procedures, thyroidectomy, parathyroidectomy, and outpatient inguinal hernia repair together accounted for 34% of procedures, but only 6% of complications (and only 4% of major complications). These same procedures accounted for ⬍ 1% of excess hospital days.  CONCLUSIONS: A relatively small number of procedures account for a disproportionate share of the morbidity, mortality, and excess hospital days in general surgery. Focusing quality improvement efforts on these procedures may be an effective strategy for improving patient care and reducing cost. (J Am Coll Surg 2008;207:698–704. © 2008 by the American College of Surgeons)  There is growing interest in measuring and improving quality of care in general surgery in the US. Until now, these efforts have focused on general aspects of periop- erative care applicable to a wide range of procedures. For example, the Surgical Care Improvement Project has targeted appropriate use of antibiotics to reduce surgical site infection (SSI), proper prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, and use of perioperative ␤-blockers to re- duce the risk of cardiac events.1,2 But there is growing recognition that improving quality in general surgery will require understanding of both processes and out- comes that are specific to individual operations.3 The American College of Surgeons National Quality Im- provement Program (ACS-NSQIP), as such, is moving toward procedure-specific measures of performance in future versions of its measurement system.4  Yet uncertainty remains about the operations on which ACS-NSQIP and other efforts should be focusing. From the perspective of quality improvement, it might make sense to consider the extent to which different operations contribute to overall morbidity and mortality.5 Such an approach would account for how frequently the operation is performed and its underlying complication rate. From the perspective of payers, it might be reasonable to priori- tize procedures according to the excess cost or length of stay attributable to procedures’ complications.  In this context, we sought to prioritize procedures for quality improvement efforts in general surgery in terms of these two perspectives. Specifically, we used data from ACS-NSQIP to describe the relative contribution of differ- ent surgical procedures to overall morbidity, mortality, and excess length of hospital stay in general surgery.6-8  Disclosure Information: Nothing to disclose.

METHODS Study population We used the most recent data available from the American College of Surgeons’ National Surgery Quality Improve- ment Program (ACS-NSQIP public use file, 2005 to  © 2008 by the American College of Surgeons Published by Elsevier Inc.  698  ISSN 1072-7515/08/$34.00 doi:10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2008.06.138  Vol. 207, No. 5, November 2008  Schilling et al  Improving Quality of Care in General Surgery  699  2006). This data file contains 152,490 deidentified surgical cases from 121 participating hospitals. The data are col- lected by trained clinical nurses and contain information on a wide spectrum of variables. For the purposes of this study, we used information on morbidity and mortality occurring within the first 30 postoperative days. This in- cluded the occurrence of superficial, deep incisional, or organ space surgical site infection, wound disruption, uri- nary tract infection, stroke or cerebrovascular accident (CVA) with neurologic deficit, coma lasting longer than 24 hours, peripheral nerve injury, cardiac arrest requiring CPR, myocardial infarction, bleeding transfusions, me- chanical failure of extracardiac graft, deep vein thrombosis or thrombophlebitis, sepsis, septic shock, return to operat- ing room, and death. ACS-NSQIP data are available to researchers at sites that participate in the program. Addi- tional details about the data are well described elsewhere.4 We created a cohort of 129,233 general surgery cases from ACS-NSQIP data by selecting those for which the primary surgeon was specified as being a general surgeon. Patients un- der the age of 18 years were excluded. We used the Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) code of the principal opera- tive procedure field to define the primary procedure of the case (Appendix). We aggregated these CPT codes into 36 clinically recognizable procedure groups. We created initial code group- ings based on the code groupings used by billing services.9 Refinement and finalization of the groupings was based on the clinical judgment of the authors and included consideration of a procedure’s anatomic location and pathologic indication. For inguinal hernia repair and cholecystectomy we dichoto- mized the procedure definitions across operative setting (in- patient versus outpatient) because of differences in baseline risk and pathologic indication. The 36 procedure categories accounted for 85% of the 129,233 cases in the cohort (109,841 cases).  Analysis We first examined procedure groups according to their rel- ative contribution to overall morbidity and mortality, ie, the public health perspective. We began by calculating the total number of patients in the entire cohort who experi- enced morbidity or mortality. For each of the 36 procedure groups, we then summed the number of patients who ex- perienced an adverse event within the first 30 postoperative days. Finally, we determined the proportion of the total number of adverse events attributable to each of the 36 procedure groups. We ranked the procedure groups in de- scending order according to their relative contribution to the cohort’s total count of adverse events.10  We then assessed procedure groups according to their relative contribution to overall excess length of stay attrib- utable to adverse events, ie, the payer perspective. We de-  fined excess length of stay for an adverse event as the dif- ference in the average length of stay for patients who did and did not experience an adverse event within the first 30 postoperative days (ie, average excess length of stay). We calculated this for each of the 36 procedure groups and determined the proportion of the cohort’s overall excess length of stay accounted for by each of the groups. Finally, we ranked the procedure groups in descending order ac- cording to their relative contribution.  We conducted a sensitivity analysis to determine how our findings would be changed by using different defini- tions of adverse events. First, we repeated the analysis, ex- cluding superficial surgical site infection as a complication. Second, we repeated the analysis using mortality as the only included adverse event. For both of these additional anal- yses, we again ranked the procedure groups based on their relative contribution to the overall morbidity or mortality in the specialty. The resultant rankings were compared against the rankings under the initial assumptions.  RESULTS Ten procedure groups accounted for 62% of the adverse events and 44% of the cases in the cohort (Table 1, Fig. 1). Colectomy registered the greatest share of complications (24%) followed by small intestine resection (8%), inpa- tient cholecystectomy (6%), ventral hernia repair (5%), and pancreatic resection (4%). In contrast, several com- mon procedures contributed little to overall morbidity and mortality. For example, outpatient cholecystectomy, breast procedures, thyroidectomy, parathyroidectomy, and out- patient inguinal hernia repair together accounted for 34% of procedures but only 6% of overall morbidity and mortality.  In general, procedure group rankings were similar re- gardless of whether they were based on overall morbidity, morbidity excluding superficial surgical site infection (SSI), or mortality (Table 2). There were a couple of nota- ble exceptions, however. Surgery for bleeding or perforated gastric ulcers accounted for only 1% of overall morbidity, but for 3% of mortality. Conversely, appendectomy and bariatric procedures each accounted for 4% of overall mor- bidity, but for ⬍ 1% of mortality.  Rankings based on excess length of stay were also similar to the rankings based on morbidity and mortality (Table 2). The top 10 procedure groups accounted for 54% of excess hospital days and 39% of cases in the cohort (Table 1, Fig. 2). The top five procedure groups were exactly the same as those based on overall morbidity and mortality, both in composition and rank order.  700  Schilling et al  Improving Quality of Care in General Surgery  J Am Coll Surg  Table 1.

Colectomy registered the greatest share of adverse events followed by small intestine  resection, inpatient cholecystectomy, ventral hernia repair, and pancreatic resection. These procedures account for a large proportion of overall adverse events because they are frequently performed, associated with high baseline risk, or both. Baseline risks, as for the latter, are no doubt a func-  Vol. 207, No. 5, November 2008  Schilling et al  Improving Quality of Care in General Surgery  701  Figure 1.

Our main finding, that morbidity and mortality are con- centrated within a small number of procedures, may be even more true for other specialties. With the possible ex- ception of orthopaedics, no specialty is as diverse as general surgery in terms of its clinical scope or the number of different procedures. In contrast, the scope of most surgical specialties is considerably narrower. So we expect that an even smaller number of procedures would account for most of the morbidity and mortality in other surgical specialties, including vascular, urologic, and cardiac surgery.  It is important to acknowledge the potential limitations of this study. The first limitation pertains to the degree to which ACS-NSQIP hospitals represent the greater universe of hospitals in the US. At present, ACS-NSQIP is substan- tially over-represented by large teaching hospitals. Of the 121 hospitals that participated in 2005 and 2006, 67% were classified as teaching hospitals. Academic hospitals may differ from community hospitals with regard to their procedure mix and their adverse event rates. Both factors could affect the generalizability of our findings. For this reason, we repeated our analysis stratifying by hospital  type. We found that the top 10 procedure groups ac- counted for the same share of procedures in community versus teaching hospitals (45% and 44%, respectively), and also the same share of adverse events (63% and 62%, re- spectively). So quality improvement efforts targeting these procedures have the potential to improve surgical care at teaching and nonteaching hospitals alike.  A second limitation pertains to the representation of the procedures sampled by ACS-NSQIP. Because the program only samples procedures performed under regional or gen- eral anesthesia, minor operations performed under local anesthesia are excluded. Because such procedures are asso- ciated with extremely low morbidity and mortality, their inclusion would not significantly alter our rank lists. At hospitals with large caseloads, ACS-NSQIP limits the in- clusion of low risk procedures by setting ceilings on the number that can be sampled during a given time period (eg, no more than five inguinal hernia repairs or laparo- scopic cholecystectomies can be selected during a given sampling period). Inclusion of all such procedures might increase, to some degree, their contribution to overall mor- bidity and mortality. But these increases would not be large enough to alter our main conclusions.  These results have important implications for future quality improvement efforts in surgery. First, surgeons might use these rankings as a guide to prioritize their local  702  Schilling et al  Improving Quality of Care in General Surgery  J Am Coll Surg  Table 2.

For example, ACS-NSQIP might be- gin targeting a small number of procedures that account for the largest share of morbidity and mortality, rather than sampling procedures across the entire breadth of the spe- cialty. Finally, our findings are relevant to value-based pur- chasing and other initiatives being led by payers and policy  makers.14-16 These rankings identify high-leverage proce- dures, not only in terms of their potential for improving patient outcomes, but also in terms of their potential for reducing excess hospital days and cost.  This article does not assess the extent to which quality improvement could reduce morbidity and mortality for each procedure. Stakeholders, as such, would undoubtedly want to consider other factors in setting their quality im-  Vol. 207, No. 5, November 2008  Schilling et al  Improving Quality of Care in General Surgery  703  Figure 2. Cumulative contribution of different procedures to overall excess length of stay in general surgery patients.  provement priorities. In particular, it would be important to weight each procedure’s potential for quality improve- ment. For some procedures, high rates of adverse outcomes may reflect the illness the patient brings to the hospital rather than the quality of care the patient receives. Small bowel resection, second only to colectomy in its contribu- tion to overall morbidity and mortality, is a good example. With this procedure, patient outcomes may be driven more by the indication for operation, eg, mesenteric ischemia or strangulated bowel, rather than the quality of care rendered within the hospital.  In this analysis, we stratified overall morbidity and mor- tality according to common procedures and procedure groups. But priorities for quality improvement might be refined by considering relevant subgroups within the pro- cedure groups. For example, procedure acuity might be an important consideration if urgent or emergent procedures are responsible for a disproportionate share of adverse events relative to elective procedures. For other procedures, it might be useful to stratify according to the underlying diagnosis (eg, appendectomy for ruptured or nonruptured appendix).  Although not sufficient as the sole criteria for prioritiz- ing quality improvement, our findings provide a useful starting point. Ultimately, improving quality will require efforts that go beyond outcomes assessment alone. Future  work should aim to improve our current understanding of processes of care associated with superior surgical outcomes.17  Appendix Procedure groups were created according to the following algorithm:  We calculated the frequency of CPT (Current Proce- dural Terminology) codes listed in the principal opera- tive procedure field for the patients in the cohort. We ranked these CPT codes in descending order from the most common principal operative procedure code to the least common code within the cohort. We began the process of code grouping by moving sequentially down the list of CPT codes in the cohort (eg, most common to least common). Initial code groupings were created by entering the CPT codes into an on-line code grouping program used by billing services. The authors made modifications to two procedure groupings. For inguinal hernia repair and cholecystectomy we dichotomized the procedure definitions across operative setting (inpatient versus outpatient) because of differences in baseline risk and pathologic indication. We continued this process until we had considered every CPT code within the cohort. At the end of this process, we had created 36  704  Schilling et al  Improving Quality of Care in General Surgery  J Am Coll Surg  procedure groups that, together, accounted for 85% of the 129,233 cases in the cohort (109,841 cases).

This study identifies factors associated with 30-day readmission after general surgery procedures.  RESULTS:  STUDY DESIGN: Using standard National Surgical Quality Improvement Project protocol, preoperative, intra- operative, and postoperative outcomes were collected on patients undergoing inpatient general surgery procedures at a single academic center between 2009 and 2011. Data were merged with our institutional clinical data warehouse to identify unplanned 30-day readmissions. Demo- graphics, comorbidities, type of procedure, postoperative complications, and ICD-9 coding data were reviewed for patients who were readmitted. Univariate and multivariate analysis was used to identify risk factors associated with 30-day readmission. One thousand four hundred and forty-two general surgery patients were reviewed. One hun- dred and sixty-three (11.3%) were readmitted within 30 days of discharge. The most common reasons for readmission were gastrointestinal problem/complication (27.6%), surgical infection (22.1%), and failure to thrive/malnutrition (10.4%). Comorbidities associated with risk of readmission included disseminated cancer, dyspnea, and preoperative open wound (p ⬍ 0.05 for all variables). Surgical procedures associated with higher rates of readmission included pancreatectomy, colectomy, and liver resection. Postoperative occurrences leading to increased risk of readmission were blood transfusion, postoperative pulmonary complication, wound complication, sepsis/shock, urinary tract infection, and vascular complications. Multivariable analysis demonstrates that the most significant independent risk factor for readmission is the occurrence of any postoperative complication (odds ratio ⫽ 4.20; 95% CI, 2.89–6.13).  CONCLUSIONS: Risk factors for readmission after general surgery procedures are multifactorial, however, post- operative complications appear to drive readmissions in surgical patients. Taking appropriate steps to minimize postoperative complications will decrease postoperative readmissions.

As a result, hospital readmis- sions quickly became an important metric for measuring quality of patient care. In March 2010, the Patient Protec- tion and Affordable Care act was signed into law and within it, Section 3025 brought substance to holding hos- pitals accountable for 30-day hospital readmissions.1 When implemented, hospital reimbursements will be re- duced based on an adjustment factor determined by an institution’s expected vs observed 30-day readmission rate. Section 3025 started the focus on readmissions for selected medical diseases, but left the door open for CMS to extend this readmission policy to surgical procedures in fiscal year 2015. The CMS has already confirmed it will begin mon- itoring readmissions for vascular surgery procedures.

There is a lack of evidence-based literature providing clinical and organizational guidelines for the management of a general surgery department. Aim of our study was to review the available recommendations published by general Surgery Societies and Health Institutions and evaluate the underlying Literature.

Surgical societies have established criteria for triage and prioritization in order to identify procedures that can be postponed after the pandemic and those that should not. Prioritization among oncologic cases represents a diﬃcult task: clinicians have to balance a possible delay in cancer diagnosis or treatment against the risk for a potential COVID-19 exposure. There is broad agreement among guidelines that indication to proceed with surgery should be dis- cussed in virtual Tumor Boards taking into consideration alternative therapeutic approaches. Several guidelines deal with the role of laparoscopic surgery during the pandemic: a tailored approach is currently suggested, with a case-by-case evaluation provided that appropriate personal protective equipment is available in order to minimize the potential risk of transmission. Finally, there is a considerable agreement in the published Literature concerning the management of the personnel during the peri- and intraoperative phase and on the technical advices regarding the induction, operative and recover maneuvers in COVID-19 cases. Conclusions: During COVID-19 pandemic, it is of paramount importance to face the emergency in the most eﬀective and eﬃcient manner, retrieving resources from non-essential settings and, at the same time, providing care to high priority non-COVID-19 related diseases.  1. Introduction  In December 2019, the outbreak of a novel and highly contagious coronavirus infection has been identiﬁed in Wuhan, China. The pa- thogen, named SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) [1], is responsible for a novel pneumonia aﬀecting the lower respiratory tract, referred to as Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). COVID-19 represents a global pandemic, aﬀecting 212 countries and territories around the world, with over 3.200.000 infected subjects and more than 228.000 deaths [2]. The exponential aﬄux of patients in need of sub- intensive or intensive care represents, for most of the healthcare sys- tems around the globe, a crisis of unprecedented magnitude in the post- world war era. While the population continues to be aﬀected by the  whole spectrum of pre-existing diseases, hospitals were swamped with a massive number of COVID-19 patients to the point that prompted the Administrations to create COVID-19 dedicated wards, ICUs and hospi- tals with redistribution of healthcare workers (HCW) from non-COVID- 19 to COVID-19 intensive and sub-intensive units. In this context, ma- jority of surgical departments were forced, both due to reduced man- power/facilities and to limit the viral spread, to re-schedule their ac- tivity and non-deferrable oncological cases. The prioritization of patients is a complex strategy that poses several organizational and ethical issues.  to urgent/emergent  giving priority  While several clinical commentaries and management indications have been published by research groups working in highly aﬀected areas, there is a lack of evidence-based literature providing clinical and  ∗ Corresponding author.

Aim of our study was to collect and review the available guidelines and recommendations published by general Surgery Societies and Health Institutions and evaluate the underlying literature.  2. Materials and Methods  The review of the Literature was reported according to the AMSTAR and the 2009 Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines [3].  An extensive search was performed to identify papers and state- ments dealing with management of surgical patients during pandemic. MEDLINE, PubMed, Embase and the Cochrane Library databases were searched up to April 24th, 2020. The following terms were searched, individually or in combination: ‘pandemic’, ‘coronavirus’, ‘COVID-19’, and ‘surgery’ or ‘surgical’. Moreover, a Google search of the topic re- lated key words was also conducted along with national and interna- tional Surgical Societies and Health Institutions websites. References of the included papers were checked to identify any additional study and the related articles function was used. After eliminating double hits, two authors independently screened the titles and abstracts for elig- ibility. For potentially relevant records, the full-text guidelines were obtained, and the inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied. Articles and guidelines in English language, reporting practical indications on operative and perioperative management during pandemics were in- cluded. Given the lack of high-quality evidence on the COVID-19 and the rapid evolution of the pandemic, we included guidelines irrespec- tive of their methodological level and their development process. In fact, most of decision-making and guideline development on this topic are based on the limited available data and information inferred from other viruses and similar epidemics. Moreover, expert opinions and author's experiences in endemic areas were considered. Editorial, commentaries, duplicated and non-English articles were excluded. We analyzed statements and recommendations regarding elective/onco- logic/emergency surgery, laparoscopy, and operations in COVID-19 positive patients.  3. Results  The initial search returned 1076 records. After eligibility assess- ment, a total of 22 papers and statements were included (Fig. 1): three Institutional guidelines, 10 Societies' guidelines and 9 original articles were analyzed [1,4–24].  3.1. Elective surgery  3.1.1. Literature review  On March 1st, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended rescheduling elective surgeries and shifting elective in- patient surgical procedures to outpatient settings, when feasible [4]. In order to guide the decision-making process, surgical societies have es- tablished criteria for triage and prioritization. Triage criteria are in- tended to guide surgical scheduling according to the hospital burden of the pandemic phase. Surgical prioritization is intended to identify the procedures that can be postponed and those that should not, balancing the risk between disease progression and viral exposure.  Triage criteria were reported by the American College of Surgeons (ACS) [25] and by Ross et al. [23] ACS [25] distinguishes three acute pandemic phases based on hospital resources availability and COVID- 19 patients burden: a progressive restriction of surgical activity follows the pandemic escalation and the potential impairment of survivorship if surgery is not performed in a determinate interval of time (Table 1). While in phase I (few COVID-19 cases), elective surgery is still per- formed but restricted to patients with survivorship possibly compro- mised if not operated within 3 months, in phase II and III only urgent/  181  emergent operations are performed. Ross et al. [23] distinguishes four diﬀerent pandemic phases according to the number of COVID-19 cases and Hospital/ICU capacity. In the alert phase (no COVID-19) elective surgery is performed as usual; with COVID-19 cases skyrocketing, re- duction by 50% should be started and eventually totally suspended performing only urgent/emergent cases.  Criteria for surgical prioritization are reported by British National Health Service (NHS) [5], ACS [26] and European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) [11] guidelines. The NHS guidelines [5] suggest to classify patients requiring surgery according to four levels of surgical priority (Table 2). Operations are distinguished in emergent (< 24 h), urgent (< 72 h) and elective (deferrable for up to 4 weeks, 3 months and beyond 3 months), providing a detailed list of surgical procedures for each category [5]. During the pandemic, surgery that can be de- ferred for up to 4 weeks might still be performed, balancing the risk between the underlying condition and the viral spread. This category includes some cancer operations and surgery for complicated benign conditions unresponsive to medical therapy. ACS [26] identiﬁes dif- ferent tiers of surgical procedures according to acuity of surgery (high, intermediate and low according to Elective Surgery Acuity Scale) and patient's general condition. High acuity surgery (most cancers and highly symptomatic patients) should not be delayed during the pan- demic. ESMO [11] identiﬁes three levels of priority (high, medium and low), deﬁned by incorporating the evaluation of the patient's overall clinical condition and the expected beneﬁt provided by the intervention in terms of survival and quality of life.  3.1.2. Discussion  Before the pandemic declaration by the WHO, it was already clear that postponing elective activities was a fundamental step, in order to preserve patients’ safety and to limit the viral spread. This measure increases the resources for COVID-19 patients, clearing ward and in- tensive care unit (ICU) beds. Moreover, it avoids unnecessary patient traﬃc in the hospital and reduces the risk of cross-infection between elective patients, hospital visitors and COVID-19 patients, preventing spread of infection from the hospital to the community [19,27]. If on one hand, postponing elective procedures is necessary, on the other, every delay in treatment, may lead to adverse outcomes. Clinicians should assess the risk of proceeding and delaying surgery considering that a possible time of 6–7 weeks could be necessary to see a decrease in COVID-19 prevalence [26]. As suggested by all Authors, a clear surgical strategy and a plan for providing essential operations during the pan- demic should be developed, in order to keep the system eﬀective. Due to a rapidly changing environment, keeping the Triage criteria in mind, all surgical systems will need to constantly adapt to the continuously evolving situation. In particular, surgical planning must take local re- sources constraints into account as a means to understand the potential impact of each decision [28].  3.2. Oncologic surgery  3.2.1. Literature review  Four Society Guidelines (Society of Surgical Oncology – SSO [12], ACS [25], ESMO [29–33] and International Society for Diseases of the Esophagus – ISDE [13]) contain detailed indications on oncologic sur- gery. Recommendations comprise operations that should be performed during and despite the pandemic and surgical treatments that can be safely postponed.  3.2.1.1. Breast cancer. In newly evaluated invasive cancers, the tumor board may decide, case by case, whether to proceed with upfront surgery versus neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAT), depending also on institutional resources [29]. Alternative approaches to be considered are hormonal therapy for some ER-positive invasive cancers and NAT for triple negative-HER2 positive tumors [25]. Primary surgery is undergo deemed  non-deferrable when  the  patient  cannot  L. Moletta, et al.  International Journal of Surgery 79 (2020) 180–188  Fig. 1.

ACS encourages the use of breast conserving deﬁnitive mastectomy only for patients whose survivorship is likely to be compromised if not operated within 3 months (provided that radiation oncology services are available) [25]. For clinically low-risk primary breast cancers, clinicians may consider starting neoadjuvant/ preoperative endocrine therapy according to menopausal status and delaying surgery [29]. Inﬂammatory and locally advanced breast cancers should receive NAT prior to surgery [25]. High priority should be given to patients who have completed NAT and to those progressing on NAT [12,25,29]. Other indications to non-deferrable  surgery are: breast cancer in pregnancy [29], excision of malignant recurrence (depending on phenotype and extent) [25,29], and discordant biopsies likely to be malignant [25,29]. In situation where hospital resources are all directed to COVID-19 patients, surgery should be limited to urgent/emergent situations such as breast abscesses, evacuation of hematomas, revision of an ischemic ﬂap [25,29]. The following scenarios can be safely postponed for the duration of the pandemic: benign lesions and duct excision, discordant biopsies likely to be benign, non-invasive breast cancer (in situ) except for extended high-grade DCIS, breast reconstruction, prophylactic surgery [25,29]. Consider adjuvant hormone/chemotherapy and radiation for minimal margin involvement, delaying margin re-resection.

Colorectal cancer. Urgent surgery should be performed for: obstructive or nearly-obstructing colorectal cancer (prefer diversion in rectal cancer), acutely transfusion-dependent tumors, cancers with pending evidence of local perforation and sepsis, post-surgical and post-colonoscopy complications [25]. For resectable colon cancer, curative intent surgery should be carried out, while NAT could be considered for locally advanced colon cancer [12]. For rectal cancer, all options for NAT should be considered. In post-neoadjuvant rectal cancer, priority should be given to those with no response to therapy [25]. In situation where hospital resources are all directed to COVID-19 patients, surgery should be limited to emergent situations (perforation, peritonitis, massive gastrointestinal bleeding, sepsis), considering patients’ transfer to hospital with capacity in all other cases [25].  The following scenarios can be safely postponed: malignant polyps, prophylactic surgery for hereditary conditions, large, benign, asymp- tomatic polyps, small, asymptomatic colon and rectal carcinoids [12,30].  3.2.1.3. Gastric and esophageal cancer. Priority should be given to surgical resection of cT1b lesions and patients with ongoing peri- operative should undergo endoscopic management if feasible while patients with cT2 cancer or higher should undergo NAT [12,25]. Timing of surgery after NAT should be individualized by balancing the risk of progression with the risk of  cT1a tumors  treatment.  183  escalates, patients  should prolong chemotherapy,  surgery and SARS-CoV-2 infection [13]. The capacity of ICU has to be considered prior to perform esophagectomy, especially in patients who are at higher risk of prolonged ICU stay [13,25]. If the COVID-19 pandemic if tolerating and responding, or switched to deﬁnitive chemoradiation, oﬀering salvage surgery only in case of failure [12,25]. In situation where hospital resources are limited, surgery should be restricted to emergencies such as perforated cancers, tumor associated infection/ sepsis, surgical complications management. Transfer of patients to other centers should be considered [25,31]. Procedure that can be postponed after the pandemic are: functional operations, bariatric surgery, surgery for benign non-aggressive tumors of the GI tract [13].  3.2.1.4. Hepatopancreatobiliary cancer. Potentially curable pancreatic adenocarcinoma (included those who have completed NAT and those with biliary/gastric obstruction), pancreatic cystic lesions with conﬁrmed high grade dysplasia, duodenal cancer, ampullary cancer, potentially curable large/multifocal hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma should undergo surgical resection [12,25,32,33]. When resources are limited, patient can prolong NAT when re- sponding and tolerating [12]. If pandemic escalates, only emergent life- saving interventions should be performed (e.g. drainage for cholangitis, gastric outlet obstruction and bleeding management) [25].  3.2.1.5. Neuroendocrine adrenal cancer. Surgery should be restricted to symptomatic or growing small bowel/pancreatic NET [12]. Surgery should not be postponed in  thyroid  and  tumors  (NET),  L. Moletta, et al.  International Journal of Surgery 79 (2020) 180–188  thyroid cancer with a current or impending threat to life, morbidity due to local invasion and aggressive biology and in adrenocortical cancer, pheochromocytoma, paraganglioma and medically resistant Cushing's syndrome [12]. Most uncomplicated endocrine operations can be delayed [12].  3.2.2. Discussion  At present, it is not possible to establish with certainty if cancer patients are at higher risk of contracting COVID-19 or experiencing severe outcomes. According to the Italian National Institute of Health, out of 1738 veriﬁed COVID-19 related deaths occurred in Italy up to April 16th, 16.2% had a history of active cancer in the last 5 years [34]. A nationwide analysis from China reported 18 out of 1590 COVID-19 cases with a history of cancer (1%; 95% CI 0.61–1.65) [35]. Cancer patients were reported to have a higher risk of severe clinical events, requiring invasive ventilation or leading to death, when compared with patients without cancer (HR 3.56 [95%CI, 1.65 to 7.69]). Clinicians have to balance a possible delay in cancer diagnosis or treatment against the risk for a potential COVID-19 exposure, taking into account limitation of healthcare resources that need to be allocated properly [36,37]. All Authors agree that indication to proceed with surgery should be discussed in virtual Tumor Boards taking into consideration that alternative therapeutic approaches should be pursued, especially in very early- or very advanced-stage diseases as tumor biology and probability of cure should always be balanced. Turaga et al. [38] con- ducted a comprehensive study involving almost 4 million cancer pa- tients who underwent deﬁnitive cancer and examined the estimated eﬀect for each 1-week delay in deﬁnitive surgery from diagnosis. They found that most cancer surgeries can be safely delayed beyond the current waiting time for at least 4 weeks without having a signiﬁcant impact on patient survival or cancer progression [38].  3.3. Emergency surgery  3.3.1. Literature review  Three society guidelines [14,15,39] and one paper [24] contain practical indications in emergency surgery management. Guidelines agree that all acute patients should be considered COVID-19 suspected cases until proven otherwise: thorough medical and close contacts history must be collected along with swab testing, chest x ray and, in patients undergoing abdominal CT scan, a chest CT scan should also be performed [14,15,39].  Non-operative or conservative management of acutely ill patients should be considered when feasible and safe, and it is strongly en- couraged with COVID-19 patients [14,15,24,39].  3.3.1.1. Trauma surgery. To proper allocate trauma patients, clinicians should always be aware of the local and regional status of resources with daily updates with local authorities. A constant communication should be present regarding regional distribution of patients, ICU capacity, ventilators allocation [14,15]. Status of blood stocks should be regularly checked [15]. In case of reduced availability of red blood concentrates (RBC), plasma-ﬁrst approach using an inverse ratio of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) to blood (2 FFP to 1 RBC) can be adopted [14]. Anyhow, the consultant in transfusion medicine has to be involved in decision-making as early as possible [14]. Evaluation of trauma patients should not be delayed to determine COVID-19 status, but is recommended for all patients [14].  rigorous use of personal protective  equipment  (PPE)  colorectal  surgery. Only  life-threatening 3.3.1.2. Emergency emergencies should be treated with surgical operations (intestinal perforation/ischemia, loop obstruction, incarcerated hernia, bleeding unresponsive [24,39]. Conservative management for adhesive small bowel obstruction can be attempted as usual practice [39]. Note that naso-gastric tube  conservative/radiological  approaches)  to  placement may be an aerosol-generating procedure and appropriate precautions are recommended [6]. For large bowel perforation, open approach is preferable. In complicated diverticulitis, conservative approach should be maximized: IV antibiotics and percutaneous drainage for Hinchey class 1 and 2 [24,39]. Surgery should be restricted to purulent or fecal peritonitis [39]. Hartmann procedure should be preferred over an anastomosis [24]. Colorectal anastomosis should be avoided in patients with suspected or conﬁrmed COVID-19, due to high risk of complications and subsequent consumption of healthcare resources [24]. Non-complicated appendicitis can be treated with non-operative management sparing of operating room (OR) resources should balance with the potential longer length of stay of conservative management [39]. In case of failure, surgical intervention should be promptly performed [39]. Appendicular abscess should be managed by percutaneous drainage if technically feasible [39]. Finally, perforated appendicitis requiring urgent surgery should be performed using an open approach in proven COVID-19 patients. Laparoscopy can be considered if adequate proctologic emergencies, any attempt should be made to manage the condition conservatively, especially in known or suspected COVID-19 positive [24]. Alternatively, management under local anesthesia in an outpatient setting should be preferred [39]. Emergency surgery should be restricted to bleeding and severe disease, or failure of conservative approach [24,39].  [24,39]. However,  [24]. Regarding  available  devices  are  3.3.2. Discussion  During a pandemic, it is essential to ensure emergency surgery care [14]. If non-operative management failed and surgery is deemed ne- cessary, there is unanimous agreement that appropriate PPE and pre- cautions should be adopted and surgery should not be delayed whilst waiting for the swab results [24,39]. Initial assessment of a potentially surgical candidate should be conducted by a senior clinician with the expertise to promptly recognize whether surgery is required [6]. De- cision to proceed should be shared and discussed with the anesthesia team given the possible paucity of ICU resources and surgery should be performed by the team most experienced member [40]. Lastly, it should be reminded that gastrointestinal symptoms are a possible manifesta- tion of COVID-19: therefore, a COVID-19 infection should be considered when assessing patients with diarrhea, abdominal pain and/or fever [27].  3.4. Laparoscopy  3.4.1. Literature review  Five society guidelines  [6–8,13,41] and 4 original articles [16–18,24] deal with the use of laparoscopy during the pandemic (Table 3). The Association of Laparoscopic Surgeons of Great Britain and Ireland (ALSGBI) [8] supports the use of laparoscopy when there are clear beneﬁt to the patients and resources guarantee safety for the OR team. According to the Intercollegiate General Surgery Guidance [6] and ISDE guidelines [13], laparoscopy should be performed only in selected cases, when clinical beneﬁt evidently outweighs the risk of viral transmission. Di Saverio et al. [24] suggests that laparoscopy should be carefully considered in COVID-19 conﬁrmed patients and only when appropriate equipment and full PPE are available and properly installed in OR. Cohen et al. [18] restricts minimally invasive surgery in COVID-19 negative patients and caution is recommended in patients with unknown COVID-19 status. No absolute contraindications on laparoscopy emerge from the Literature review, but appropriate PPE for OR team and smoke evacuation/ﬁltration systems are unanimously recommended [6,8,41].  3.4.2. Discussion  Laparoscopy is based upon the creation and maintenance of a pneumoperitoneum and the use of energy devices with a subsequent  184  L. Moletta, et al.

Aerosolization of blood born viruses has been previously detected in surgical smoke during laparo- scopy [43,44]. Therefore, a potential risk of aerosol exposure must be considered also for SARS-CoV-2 even though there isn't current de- monstration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA presence in the surgical smoke [16]. On the other hand, proven beneﬁts of laparoscopy should be considered during COVID-19 pandemic, such as reduced length of stay and com- plications (and a potential minor burden on healthcare system). Moreover, at the present, there is very little evidence about the relative risks of laparoscopy versus open surgery, speciﬁc to COVID-19 [7]. While laparoscopy has the potential for ultraﬁltration of the majority if not all aerosolized particles, open surgery has a similar potential to generate aerosols without the possibility of safely containing the sur- gical smoke [7,17,45]. From the Literature review, we can conclude that a tailored approach is currently suggested, with a case-by-case evaluation considering surgeon expertise, patient- and disease-related factors provided that appropriate PPE and OR equipment are available in order to minimize the potential risk of transmission.  3.5. Surgical procedures in COVID-19 conﬁrmed patients  3.5.1. Literature review  Two Institutional guidelines [1,46], 5 Surgical Societies’ guidelines [6,7,9,13,41,47] and 6 original articles [16,19–22,24] were identiﬁed, reporting practical indications on the organization of the operative and perioperative setting during the COVID-19 pandemic (Table 4).  3.5.1.1. Preoperative management. Transportation of all suspected and conﬁrmed cases from and to ICU/ward/OR should take place using dedicated hospital staﬀ [20,24,41,47] following the shortest pre- determined, dedicated route, avoiding common spaces and stalling. Non-intubated patients should wear a surgical mask [20], disposable gloves, cap and shoe covers. The use of a dedicated transport ventilator is advised for intubated patients [21,22]. The hospital staﬀ is responsible for route clearing and sanitization of the stretcher and utilized elevators [21].  In accordance with the WHO and the CDC statement [1,46], aerosol generating procedures (intubation, non-invasive/manual ventilation, bronchoscopy) should be performed in negative pressure anterooms [7,9,21,22,41,47]. Whenever not available, such procedures should be conducted in the OR [6,13] and taped oﬀ areas should be clearly marked to drop oﬀ the supplies [19]. The HCWs involved in these phases should be limited, surgical team should wait outside.  3.5.1.2. OR management. The majority of Authors suggests the use of a dedicated OR, preferably located out of high-traﬃc areas and close to the block entrance [7,9,19–22]. Negative pressure ORs are considered ideal [21,46]; however, most ORs work at positive pressure and their use is therefore obviously permitted [7,9,20,41,47]. An air exchange  rate ≥25 cycles/hour is considered suﬃcient to eﬀectively reduce the viral load within the OR [22].  Only essential members of the staﬀ should be admitted in the OR, limiting in/out traﬃc, doors should be kept closed. A HCW should re- main outside the OR for supplies that should be delivered through charts to avoid handling-related contamination. Only essential equip- ment should be kept in, patients’ records should be kept outside [6,7,9,19–22,41,47]. All operators involved in the procedure should be tracked to identify HCWs at risk of infection [20].  The use of energy devices should be limited and at the lowest pos- sible setting and long dissection in the same spot should be avoided [7,16]. The Authors recommend a thorough use of smoking evacuators and avoidance of leakage through port incisions [6,7,13,16,47]. Pneu- moperitoneum should be kept at the lowest possible levels and elec- tromedical units’ surfaces should be covered [16,20,22].  3.5.1.3. Postoperative management. Extubation should occur, with essential personnel, in a negative pressure ICU/ward room or, if not available, in the OR [19–21,24,41,48]. The PPE should be discarded in a dedicated doﬃng area. Scrubs should be changed after each procedure and showering is encouraged [20–22].  At the end of the operation the breathing circuit and the canister of soda lime should be discarded [22]. The OR should be kept empty to allow air exchange (from 15 to 20/hour to ≥25/hour for approxi- mately 30 min), cleaning service can then follow [9,13,20,21]. The CDC advocates the appropriateness of EPA-registered disinfectants contained in the List N for routine cleaning and disinfection [46].  3.5.2. Discussion  While there is a considerable agreement in the published literature concerning the management of the personnel during the peri- and in- traoperative phase and on the technical advices regarding the induc- tion, operative and recover maneuvers, the literature's statements on the use of the surgical spaces is more controversial. In accordance with the WHO and the CDC [1,46], aerosol generating procedures (tracheal intubation, non-invasive ventilation, manual ventilation, broncho- scopy) should be performed in negative pressure ante-rooms, subse- quently transferring the patient to the OR. Since such logistical re- sources are rarely available in the surgical departments, several authors prompt the use of the OR for patients' induction and recovery, in order to overcome this issue [6,13,19,20,22,24]. Similarly, while negative pressure ORs are considered ideal to minimize the infection risk [21,46], given their greater availability the use of positive pressure ORs is widely accepted for the for the treatment of COVID-19 cases [7,9,19,20,22,24], provided that an adequate air exchange rate is uti- lized [20,22]. From our review of the literature we can conclude that the viral spread through aerosol generating procedures and direct/in- direct contact can be eﬃciently reduced by a rational use of the available spaces, even in absence of more advanced containment  185  L.

Reopening of elective procedures  Research registration number  As the rate of new COVID-19 cases decrease, a progressive re- opening of elective procedures will be necessary. HCWs and institutions must prepare for a substantial demand of surgical care, for all those patients who could not be treated during the pandemic. ACS provided a Join Statement together with ASA, EORN, AHA with general principles to guide resumption of elective surgery [48]. A substantial reduction of new COVID-19 cases for at least 14 days is deemed necessary before the reopening. Institutions have to guarantee patients and staﬀ safety through an appropriate COVID-19 testing policy and adequate provi- sion of PPE. Facilities should implement social distancing policies for staﬀ, patient and patient visitors following local and national re- commendations. Prioritization of cases requires a collegial discussion between surgeons, anesthesiologists and nurses and principles such as specialties prioritization (cancer, transplants, cardiac surgery) should be considered. Post-COVID-19 patients who require operation should be carefully evaluated: readiness for surgery require a multidisciplinary evaluation (surgeon and anesthesiology) and appropriate peri and postoperative policies have to be established.  This study has two main limitations: since the COVID-19 pandemic is still a developing crisis, our knowledge and, as a consequence, the published evidence are constantly evolving, thus the indications re- ported in this review could be subject to future revision. Moreover, most of the published guidelines and authors’ publications are based on personal expertise and experience derived from previous similar epi- demics.  4. Conclusion  COVID-19 pandemic is demanding an enormous eﬀort to Health Systems around the Globe. It is of paramount importance to face the emergency in the most eﬀective and eﬃcient manner, retrieving re- sources from non-essential settings and, at the same time, providing care to high priority non-COVID-19 related diseases. Surgeons were called to act upon delicate choices, based on individual discernment, experience and available knowledge.  The present paper,  summarize the few available re- commendations and guidelines, tries to facilitate those involved in fa- cing the intricate decisions.  that  Ethical Approval  Ethical Approval was given by the Institutional Review Board of our  Department.

Laporte, Clinical Pharmacological Unit, HoÃ pital Bellevue, Pavillon 5, F-42055 Saint-Etienne, France (e-mail: laportes@univ-st-etienne.fr)  Background: Low molecular weight heparins (LMWHs) have become routine thromboprophylaxis in general surgery. However, their actual clinical effect, its magnitude relative to that of unfractionated heparin (UFH), and the optimal dose are still debated. Methods: A meta-analysis was performed of all available randomized trials in general surgery comparing LMWH with placebo or no treatment, or with UFH. Results: Comparison versus placebo or no treatment con®rmed that the signi®cant reduction in asymptomatic deep vein thrombosis (DVT) obtained with LMWH (n = 513; relative risk (RR) 0´28 (95 per cent con®dence interval 0´14±0´54)) was associated with a signi®cant reduction in clinical pulmonary embolism (n = 5456; RR 0´25 (0´08±0´79)) and clinical venous thromboembolism (VTE) (n = 4890; RR 0´29 (0´11±0´73)), and a trend towards a reduction in overall mortality rate. Comparison versus UFH showed a trend in favour of LMWH, with a signi®cant reduction in clinical VTE (P = 0´049), a trend also found for cancer surgery. LMWH at doses below 3400 anti-Xa units seemed to be as effective as, and safer than, UFH, while higher doses yielded slightly superior ef®cacy but increased haemorrhagic risk, including that of major haemorrhage. Conclusion: Asymptomatic DVT may be regarded as a reliable surrogate endpoint for clinical outcome in studies investigating thromboprophylaxis in general surgery. LMWH seems to be as effective and safe as UFH. Determination of the optimal dose regimen of LMWH for this indication requires further investigation.  Paper accepted 1 March 2001  British Journal of Surgery 2001, 88, 913±930  Introduction  Low molecular weight heparins (LMWHs) have become the reference treatment for venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis in patients undergoing general surgery, mainly on the basis of their ability to reduce the incidence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) detected systematically using an objective test at the end of the treatment period1,2. However, the clinical relevance of a reduction in asympto- matic DVT has been questioned, as it has never been demonstrated in a single clinical study that this is associated with a reduction in the incidence of clinically important VTE3. If it is assumed that the reason for this is a lack of statistical power owing to inadequate sample size, meta- analysis may be an appropriate tool to recognize the clinical ef®cacy of LMWHs in general surgery, as well as their effects on other clinical endpoints such as major haemor- rhage or overall mortality rate. Only two rather dated meta-  analyses of LMWH versus placebo or no treatment have addressed this issue. They showed that a reduction in the risk of asymptomatic DVT was associated with a reduction in the risk of pulmonary embolism (PE) or death4,5; this has also been found for other prophylactic indications for both LMWH and unfractionated heparin (UFH)4±8. It is now worthwhile to update these two meta-analyses with more recent studies.  The effect of LMWH relative to that of UFH varies between the available meta-analyses, which included different numbers of studies4,5,9±12. This may be explained by the different criteria used to select studies, and different exhaustivity in terms of the number of studies included compared with the total number potentially eligible at the time the meta-analysis was performed. Exhaustivity has been postulated to be a critical factor for the validity and interpretation of meta-analyses13. Furthermore, the num- ber of published studies conducted in patients undergoing  ã 2001 Blackwell Science Ltd  British Journal of Surgery 2001, 88, 913±930  913   13652168, 2001, 7, Downloaded from https://bjssjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.0007-1323.2001.01800.x by University Of Ottawa Library, Wiley Online Library on [06/02/2023].

Mismetti, S. Laporte, J.-Y. Darmon, A. BuchmuÈ ller and H. Decousus  surgery for cancer should now allow the evaluation of LMWH in this subgroup of patients who are considered to be at high risk of both VTE and haemorrhage1,2. The optimal dose of LMWH to be used for thromboprophylaxis in general surgery remains controversial; both low and high doses have been proposed by various manufacturers. According to some authors, a daily subcutaneous dose of more than 3400 anti-Xa units yields no additional bene®t in terms of ef®cacy while leading to an increased haemor- rhagic risk1,10,11.  In the light of the above, a meta-analysis was carried out with three speci®c objectives in mind. (1) To verify the clinical effect of LMWH from data obtained from all available randomized clinical trials comparing a LMWH with placebo or no treatment, or with UFH, in patients undergoing general surgery. (2) To evaluate this effect in patients undergoing surgery for cancer. (3) To assess the ef®cacy and safety of low and high prophylactic doses of LMWH in this setting.  Methods  Literature search  An exhaustive literature search, both manual and computer assisted (Medlineâ and Current Contentsâ) was performed, encompassing randomized studies comparing a prophylac- tic regimen of LMWH with any other prophylactic treatment in patients undergoing general surgery, de®ned as abdominothoracic (excluding vascular), urological and gynaecological surgery, as well as surgery for malignant disease. There was no restriction on the language of the article. The following keywords were used: general surgery, abdominal surgery, cancer surgery, heparin, low molecular weight heparin, postoperative complications, prophylaxis, controlled trial, randomized trial, venous thromboembo- lism, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism and mortality. Abstracts of meetings were searched and reference lists in reviews, studies and previous meta- analyses were checked. Particular attention was paid to duplicate reports; when studies were published as an abstract and an original article, only the latter was considered. When more than one article was available from a single study, an attempt was made to extract the information required from all relevant publications. All citations have been included in the list of references.  Study selection  From these articles, open-label, single- or double-blind randomized studies evaluating a LMWH were selected.  Only studies with a control group, either untreated or treated with a placebo, or with low-dose UFH, were considered. Studies that included dihydroergotamine or elastic stockings were eligible. Included studies were required to evaluate the ef®cacy and/or safety of a LMWH using at least one of the following criteria: DVT detected by a systematic objective test, PE, major haemor- rhage or death.  Studies were excluded if they were not randomized or clearly stated as such, conducted according to a `play-the- winner design', or conducted in patients undergoing orthopaedic surgery, non-cancer thoracic surgery, extra- corporeal circulation surgery or non-cancer laparoscopic surgery. Dose-ranging studies without a control group given placebo or no treatment, or UFH, for comparison were excluded, as were studies involving heparinoids.  Collection of data  Prede®ned data from individual trials were initially extracted independently by three of the authors (P.M., S.L., J.-Y.D.). A concordance meeting was organized and, in cases of discrepancy regarding either study selection or data extraction, agreement was reached. The following study characteristics were recorded: name of the ®rst author or study acronym, year(s) of publication, number of patients randomized, indication for surgery (general, abdominal, gynaecological or cancer surgery), percentage of patients undergoing surgery for cancer and, if there was a strati®ca- tion of patients with cancer, the type, duration and dose regimens of treatments, and whether they were adminis- tered before or after operation, in an open-label, single- or double-blind fashion, the type of anaesthesia (general or regional), the method used to detect DVT and at which time point, and the duration of follow-up.  Endpoints  The primary endpoint was the incidence of DVT detected systematically by ultrasonography, ®brinogen uptake test, impedance plethysmography, thermography or venography at the end of the treatment period or earlier in cases of clinical suspicion. Positive results of impedance plethysmo- graphy or thermography had to be con®rmed by veno- graphy.  Secondary endpoints were the incidence of symptomatic PE (both non-fatal and fatal), symptomatic VTE (DVT and/or PE), death, major haemorrhage, wound haematoma and other haemorrhage (excluding haematoma at the injection site) and the percentage of patients requiring postoperative transfusion (if available, otherwise the  British Journal of Surgery 2001, 88, 913±930  www.bjs.co.uk  ã 2001 Blackwell Science Ltd   13652168, 2001, 7, Downloaded from https://bjssjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.0007-1323.2001.01800.x by University Of Ottawa Library, Wiley Online Library on [06/02/2023].

Decousus · Low molecular weight heparin in general surgery 915  percentage of patients requiring transfusion irrespective of time it was used). The de®nitions of major haemorrhage used in the original articles were heterogeneous. Whenever available, the author's de®nition was used. Otherwise, haemorrhage leading to death, blood transfusion, reopera- tion or permanent discontinuation of the treatment under assessment was considered as a major haemorrhage. The incidences of symptomatic VTE and death were derived from the complete period of follow-up, not just that of thromboprophylaxis or hospital stay. Haemorrhagic end- points were recorded at the end of the treatment period.  Statistical analysis  The results from each trial were summarized on an intention-to-treat basis in two-by-two tables for each endpoint. The denominator used for estimating the incidence of DVT was the number of patients who had undergone a systematic detection test at the end of the treatment period (available patients). For all other end- points, the denominator was the number of randomized patients in each treatment group.  Two meta-analyses were performed, the ®rst using data from trials comparing LMWH with no treatment or placebo, and the second using data from trials comparing LMWH with UFH. The meta-analyses were performed using a variety of methods: logarithm of the relative risk (RR), logarithm of the odds ratio, Mantel Haenszel, Cochran and Peto13. Since the results obtained were similar, only those from the logarithm of the RR method are presented. A RR of 1 indicates no difference between the treatments, less than 1 that LMWH is better, and more than 1 that the control treatment (either no treatment or placebo, or UFH) is better. Association and heterogeneity tests were performed for each meta-analysis. P < 0´05 from an association test and a P < 0´10 from a heterogeneity test were considered as statistically signi®cant. In the absence of a clear explanation for heterogeneity, a random-effect model for the RR was planned. Meta-analyses were performed using the software EasyMAâ (University Claude Bernaud, Lyon, France)14,15. Results from these meta-analyses are presented graphically including RRs with 95 per cent con®dence intervals (c.i.).  Two sensitivity analyses were performed, the ®rst dealing with studies in which LMWH was given in combination with dihydroergotamine and the second according to the twice daily versus UFH dose regimen (5000 units 5000 units three times daily). Subgroup analyses were performed for studies that were well identi®ed double-blind trials, for cancer surgery (studies with over 90 per cent of patients undergoing cancer surgery or data from studies with a cancer surgery stratum), for non-cancer surgery, and  for LMWH dose regimens of 3400 anti-Xa units or less and more than 3400 anti-Xa units.  Results  A total of 82 studies, from 1984 to 1999, evaluating the thromboprophylactic effect of LMWH in general surgery was identi®ed. Of these, 21 were excluded for the following reasons: absence or uncertainty of randomization in six studies16±21, play-the-winner design in two studies22,23, comparison of LMWHs in seven studies24±30, use of a heparinoid in two studies31,32, and incomplete33,34 or unpublished results (Samama 1990 and Koppenhagen 1990) in four studies. Fifty-nine studies were therefore selected, eight comparing a LMWH with placebo or no treatment35±43 and 51 comparing a LMWH with UFH44±103.  Low molecular weight heparin versus placebo or no treatment  Description of studies The eight studies contained 5520 patients; six were double blind35±40,42 and two were open41,43 (Table 1). The LMWHs used were nadroparin (three studies, 4751 patients), enoxaparin (two studies, 392 patients), dalteparin (one study, 197 patients), parnaparin (one study, 100 patients) and tinzaparin (one study, 80 patients). Two studies, both open, were conducted in cancer surgery41,43. DVT was detected systematically at the treatment period in ®ve studies (513 patients); clinical ef®cacy and safety endpoints were available for 4890±5456 patients (Table 2).  the end of  Results In the placebo or no treatment group, the adjusted incidences of events(S.D.) were 14´5(2´2) per cent for systematically detected DVT, 0´5(0´1) per cent for clinical PE, 0´9(0´2) per cent for clinical VTE and 0´9(0´2) per cent for death. A statistically signi®cant 72 per cent reduction in the risk of DVT was observed in the LMWH group (RR 0´28 (95 per cent c.i. 0´14±0´54); P < 0´001). This reduction was associated with similar signi®cant reductions in the risk of clinical endpoints, 75 per cent for clinical PE (RR 0´25 (0´08±0´79); P = 0´018) and 71 per cent for clinical VTE (RR 0´29 (0´11±0´73); P = 0´009), and with a non-signi®cant 46 per cent reduction in overall mortality rate (RR 0´54 (0´27±1´10); P = 0´09) (Fig. 1).

Only one study each was identi®ed for other LMWHs. LMWH was administered before operation in 50 of the 51 studies.  UFH was given at the dose of 5000 units three times daily in 20 studies, 5000 units twice daily in 30 studies and 2500 units twice daily in one study. Eight studies, including the cancer stratum of the European Fraxiparin Study, involved the treatment of cancer48,53±55,73,91,100±102. Thirty- three studies were double blind. DVT was detected systematically at the end of the treatment period in 41 studies (17 995 patients), and the clinical ef®cacy and safety endpoints were available for 13 776 to 46 646 patients (Table 4).  Results In the UFH group the adjusted incidences of events were 5´0(0´2) per cent for systematically detected DVT, 0´4(0´0) per cent for clinical PE, 1´3(0´1) per cent for clinical VTE and 1´7(0´1) per cent for death. A non-signi®cant 10 per cent reduction in the risk of DVT was observed in the LMWH group (RR 0´90 (0´79±1´02); P = 0´10) as well as a non- signi®cant 12 per cent reduction in the risk of clinical PE  ã 2001 Blackwell Science Ltd  www.bjs.co.uk  British Journal of Surgery 2001, 88, 913±930   13652168, 2001, 7, Downloaded from https://bjssjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.0007-1323.2001.01800.x by University Of Ottawa Library, Wiley Online Library on [06/02/2023].

The RR for each criterion is shown as a vertical line within a box, which represents the 95 per cent con®dence interval. A RR of less than 1 indicates that LMWH is more effective than UFH. If the value of 1 is included in the box, the result is not signi®cant (P > 0´05). PH indicates the result of the heterogeneity test. *A random model for the RR method had to be used because the heterogeneity test was positive, without any clear explanation for this heterogeneity between studies. DVT, deep vein thrombosis; PE, pulmonary embolism  per cent respectively. There was a reduction in the risk of major haemorrhage, total haemorrhage and wound haema- toma in the LMWH group, but this trend did not reach statistical signi®cance (Fig. 2).  Table 5 presents the results of this meta-analysis accord- ing to the different LMWHs involved. Only criteria for which the overall meta-analysis showed statistical signi®- cance or a trend towards statistical signi®cance are displayed.  Sensitivity analyses  The meta-analysis results were not modi®ed when dihy- droergotamine treatment was taken into account and did not vary with UFH dose regimen (5000 units twice or three times daily) (data not shown).  Low molecular weight heparin versus unfractionated heparin in double-blind studies  When only the well identi®ed double-blind studies were considered, the trends observed in favour of LMWH in the meta-analysis of all studies disappeared, not only for ef®cacy but also for safety criteria (Fig. 3).  Low molecular weight heparin versus unfractionated heparin in cancer surgery  The incidences of ef®cacy and safety criteria were higher in patients undergoing cancer surgery than in other patients (Table 6). However, the ef®cacy and safety of LMWH relative to UFH were similar in patients with cancer to those in patients without malignant disease (Fig. 4).

DVT, deep vein thrombosis; PE, pulmonary embolism  Low and high prophylactic dose regimens of low molecular weight heparin versus unfractionated heparin  Compared with UFH, low-dose LMWH (3400 anti-Xa units or less) did not signi®cantly reduce the risk of VTE irrespective of the criteria used (systematically detected DVT at the end of the treatment period, clinical PE or clinical VTE) (Fig. 5). However, while achieving similar ef®cacy as UFH, low-dose LMWH was associated with a signi®cant reduction in haemorrhagic risk, in particular that of major haemorrhage (RR 0´76 (0´63±0´92); P = 0´005) (Fig. 5).  Conversely, high-dose LMWH (more than 3400 anti-Xa units) appeared to be more effective than UFH, particularly with regard to clinical PE which was signi®cantly reduced in the LMWH group (RR 0´18 (0´04±0´89); P = 0´035). This better ef®cacy was counterbalanced by a signi®cant increase in the risk of haemorrhage, in particular that of major  haemorrhage (RR 1´53 (1´07±2´19); P = 0´02) (Fig. 5). Although the number of studies was small, similar ®ndings were obtained in patients undergoing cancer surgery (data not shown).  Discussion  In the absence of prophylactic treatment, the incidence of DVT when checked systematically on the tenth day after surgery was found to be approximately 15 per cent, with a risk of PE close to 0´5 per cent. This incidence is lower than that generally accepted in various consensus state- ments1,2,104. Patients undergoing general surgery therefore present an inherent risk of DVT similar to that of internal medicine patients6 and patients with acute myocardial infarction105, but less than that of those having orthopaedic surgery1,2,4,5 or experiencing stroke8.

DVT, deep vein thrombosis; PE, pulmonary embolism  risk of DVT checked systematically at the end of treatment, compared with placebo or no treatment. This result is consistent with those reported in the meta-analyses con- ducted for other indications. Indeed, whether in internal medicine6, orthopaedic surgery4,5, stroke8 or myocardial infarction105, a constant reduction of 60±70 per cent of the risk of DVT is achieved by UFH or LMWH relative to placebo or no treatment, despite the different intrinsic risks of DVT in these situations in the absence of prophylaxis.  This 72 per cent reduction is associated with similar reductions of 75 per cent in clinical PE and 71 per cent in clinical VTE. This meta-analysis therefore appears to validate the evaluation criterion of `asymptomatic DVT' as a surrogate endpoint for clinically important post- operative VTE. Despite an increase in major haemorrhage, the observed prophylactic effect of LMWH on VTE also seems to be associated with a non-signi®cant reduction of 46 per cent in overall mortality rate (RR 0´54). The failure of  the difference in this criterion to reach statistical signi®- cance seems to be a problem of statistical power; only 5142 patients were evaluated on this criterion. To show a signi®cant reduction of 50 per cent in overall mortality, a total of 8000 patients per group would have been necessary (with a = 5 per cent and b = 10 per cent).  With regard to the evaluation of haemorrhagic events, the criterion of wound haematoma could be proposed as a surrogate endpoint for major haemorrhage. Indeed, wound haematomas occur more frequently than major haemor- rhages (10´3 versus 2´8 per cent) and the increase in frequency of both events under heparin treatment is comparable; RR of 1´88 for wound haematoma and of 2´03 for major haemorrhage.  As the reference treatment for VTE prophylaxis in general surgery in the 1980s was UFH7, it was of interest to evaluate the effect of LMWH relative to UFH.

These results are not modi®ed by the level of risk associated with the type of surgery, i.e. cancer surgery versus non-cancer surgery. The observed trend in favour of LMWH should be viewed with caution since, when only double-blind studies are taken into account, the results show a close similarity of LMWH and UFH with regard to both thromboembolic and haemor- rhagic events. These results are in agreement with those published by Koch et al.11 in 1997, with respect to asymptomatic DVT and wound haematoma; they update this previous meta-analysis with eight additional double- blind studies and more than 25 000 additional patients. In addition, similar ®ndings were observed for clinical end- points. However, even if LMWH is merely as effective as UFH in the prophylaxis of VTE, the former is now the reference treatment for reasons of ease of use.  LMWHs differ to some extent in their pharmacokinetic and anticoagulant pro®les, and results obtained with one LMWH may not be simply extrapolated to another since  treatment regimens differ somewhat between drugs106,107. The present results support this, as nadroparin and parnaparin showed better ef®cacy than UFH when considering asymptomatic DVT and clinical thromboem- bolism, whereas there were fewer wound haematomas with certoparin than with UFH (Table 5). However, these results should be interpreted cautiously in the absence of any direct comparison between LMWHs.  For general surgery, which involves only moderate thrombotic risk in comparison to orthopaedic surgery, the use of low prophylactic doses of LMWH (3400 anti-Xa units or less) seems to be as effective and safer than UFH. In contrast, high doses of LMWH (more than 3400 anti-Xa units) appear to be more effective, but less safe than UFH. This threshold of 3400 anti-Xa units has already been suggested1,10,11 and permits a distinction between the low- dose and high-dose prophylactic regimens proposed by the pharmaceutical ®rms manufacturing the various LMWHs currently available. Three studies provide a direct compar- ison between low and high doses of LMWH25,27,29.  ã 2001 Blackwell Science Ltd  www.bjs.co.uk  British Journal of Surgery 2001, 88, 913±930   13652168, 2001, 7, Downloaded from https://bjssjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.0007-1323.2001.01800.x by University Of Ottawa Library, Wiley Online Library on [06/02/2023].

Mismetti, S. Laporte, J.-Y. Darmon, A. BuchmuÈ ller and H. Decousus  However, only the study reported by Bergqvist et al.29 had suf®cient statistical power (2097 patients) to show that the high-dose LMWH reduces the incidence of asymptomatic DVT by 50 per cent compared with low-dose LMWH, but at the cost of a fourfold greater risk of major haemorrhage. In view of the paucity of data providing any direct comparison of different doses, it remains dif®cult to say which dosage regimen of LMWH, high or low, yields the better risk : bene®t ratio in general surgery and, in particular, in cancer surgery.  In conclusion, asymptomatic DVT may be regarded as a reliable surrogate endpoint for clinical outcomes in studies investigating thromboprophylaxis surgery. LMWH is at least as effective and as safe as UFH.

The procedure involves excising the tumor while preserving as much of  the surrounding healthy tissue as possible. The excised tongue tumor is sent to a pathologist to analyze the  tissue,  negative  margins  indicate  that  the  tumor  was  sufficiently  removed  from  the  patient  [1].  The  computer-navigation system, NaviKnife, uses real-time electromagnetic tracking to determine the location  of the surgical tools  relative to the patient anatomy,  originally developed for  breast-conserving surgery.  When tested the system resulted in the resection of less healthy tissue as well as increased confidence for  the surgeons [2]. In this work, we present the technical challenges and potential solutions when translating  previously designed computer navigated systems to glossectomy.  METHODS:  The  NaviKnife  system  was  initially  tested  for  glossectomy by directly applying it to a simulated workspace (Figure  1). However, implementing NaviKnife in its current iteration within  the glossectomy workspace posed a series of challenges that must be  solved. The first challenge comes from the constrained glossectomy  workspace.  Due  to  the  minimal  workspace  within  the  operating  room  the  NaviKnife  tumor  tracking  methods  must  be  compact  to  prevent  it  from  disrupting  the  surgeon  while  maintaining  a  high  accuracy. Another issue is the complex anatomy of the tongue, as it has the lingual artery which if breached  can  cause  excessive  bleeding.  The  current  standard  for  tracking  tumors  within  NaviKnife  is  to  use  ultrasound imaging to generate a 3D visualization in the navigational software, while inserting a tracked  needle within the tumor. This could pose challenges for the surgeon  if the lingual artery is pierced causing complications for the patient.   RESULTS:  The  standard  electromagnetic  tracking  elements  used  for NaviKnife while effective for operations with larger workspaces  are  too  large  and  bulky  for  use  in  glossectomies.  The  tracking  methods must be redesigned  to prevent disrupting the surgeon and  harming the surrounding anatomical structures within the tongue. A  potential solution includes  implementing a  small  sensor which can  be inserted directly within the tumor to be tracked instead of using a  tracked needle (Figure 2). Due to the small nature of the sensor, it  will  prevent  overcrowding  in  the  surgeon’s  workspace  during  the  procedure.  CONCLUSION:  The  study  captures  the  complexity  of  implementing  computer  navigation  within  a  constrained  workspace.  Within  such  a  workspace  the  tracking  techniques  must  be  reinvented  to  allow  comfortable  non-invasive  tracking.  Future  work  includes  comparing  different  tracking  elements  to  determine their performance in a given workspace. Determining new methods for tracking within different  surgical contexts that hold unique constraints  may allow  for  the simple translation of existing computer  navigation systems to different surgical fields.

Lewis, MD,  ∗  and Mary E. Klingensmith, MD†  T he operations which are done by general surgeons, and the way  in which they are done, have undergone radical change during the last 2 decades, yet the impacts on residency training have not been generally recognized. The change has come about because of 2 principal factors—evolutionary and technological changes, which have occurred in the treatment of several common diseases, and the conversion of a major proportion of abdominal surgery from an open to a laparoscopic approach.  In addition to the change in the nature of the surgery done, the impact of the 80-hour workweek on resident experiences with urgent and emergent conditions has also been signiﬁcant. The impact of this on the development of resident independence and autonomy has not been analyzed.  This article will attempt to describe qualitatively the nature of the changes, the negative impacts on resident training, and some proposed measures to mitigate the impact.  ENVIRONMENTAL AND TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE  IN DISEASE MANAGEMENT  Four common disease categories, which involve intra- abdominal pathology, have undergone major technological change in management during the last 20 years.  Benign Peptic Ulcer Disease  Benign gastric and duodenal ulcer disease has been a staple of general surgical management for decades, for treatment of the com- plications of bleeding, perforation, and intractability. Three advances in medical treatment have markedly altered the incidence of these complications, and the consequent need for surgical intervention: H2 receptor blockers, proton pump inhibitors, and treatment of Heli- cobacter pylori gastric infection. As a result of medical management with these 3 modalities, intractability of ulcer disease has virtually disappeared, and perforation and hemorrhage have been markedly reduced. The result is that surgery is infrequently necessary today for treatment of peptic ulcer complications and resident experience with gastric surgery is largely limited to malignancy and other less com- mon conditions. Interestingly, the increase in laparoscopic bariatric surgery has provided the bulk of a typical resident experience in gastric surgery in recent years, but exposure to these procedures is highly variable, and residents are rarely the operating surgeon in these complex technical procedures.  Biliary Tree Stone Disease  Common duct stone disease is a frequent general surgical prob- lem, typically causing ductal obstruction or pancreatitis, which in the  From the  ∗  American Board of Surgery, Philadelphia, PA; and †Department of  Surgery, Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, MO.

Today, the technological innovations possible with ﬂexible endoscopy and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography have allowed most stones to be extracted endoscopically; these have markedly reduced the need for common duct exploration and stone removal. The con- sequence of this on resident training has been so dramatic that most graduating surgical residents today have done no common duct ex- plorations, whereas it was previously a common part of abdominal surgical experience.  Abdominal Vascular Surgery  Intra-abdominal aortoiliac occlusive and aneurysmal disease have been treated by both general surgeons and vascular surgeons since the 1950s, when synthetic vascular graft replacements ﬁrst be- came available. Both of these disease categories were typically treated with aortoiliac and aortofemoral graft replacement via open abdom- inal procedures. Two changes, both technological, occurred in the 1990s which altered this scenario: endovascular manipulation of oc- clusive disease became feasible and effective, allowing the dilatation and stenting of most aortoiliac lesions; and intraluminal endovas- cular graft insertion, a remarkable technological achievement, was developed for the treatment of aneurysmal disease, with markedly re- duced patient morbidity from the treatment. Both of these procedures are technologically complex, and competence in the performance of such procedures became possible only with the additional training that occurred with vascular fellowship after general surgical training. Most general surgeons without additional vascular surgical training, and general surgical residents, were unable to gain sufﬁcient expe- rience with these procedures to become proﬁcient, and were opted out of them, effectively removing aortoiliac vascular disease from the conditions which general surgeons could treat.  Trauma  Injuries have constituted a signiﬁcant portion of general surgi- cal experience for decades, and continue to do so, but the nature of traumatic injuries, and their management, has changed signiﬁcantly. Three speciﬁc events account for this: (1) the incidence of abdominal penetrating trauma, which requires surgical intervention in 80% to 90% of cases, decreased markedly in the United States between 1992 and 2002. Overall, the incidence of penetrating trauma decreased by approximately 60% during this decade in all geographical regions, both urban and rural, and has remained low even now. Despite the dramatic nature of this decline, it has largely escaped public notice and causation is undeﬁned. Whatever the reason, the decrease caused a marked reduction in the need for abdominal surgery in most urban centers, as penetrating trauma has always been the injury requiring the largest proportion of open surgical intervention.  In addition to the decline in penetrating trauma, the incidence of blunt trauma, due largely to automobile trauma, declined by about 20% between 1980 and 2010, as seat belts and airbags came into universal usage. Although blunt trauma is mostly managed nonoper- atively and requires surgery only 10% to 20% of the time, this caused a further decrease in the operative experience of residents and trauma surgeons.  Lastly, from the mid 1980s onward to 2000, the advent of computerized tomographic scanning, and the steady increase in reso- lution of that modality, made it possible to diagnose in greater detail www.annalsofsurgery.com | 553  Copyright © 2012 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

The increased diagnos- tic accuracy often allowed the anatomical details of intra-abdominal pathology to be more fully deﬁned and therefore reduced the need for exploratory laparotomy, which was often nontherapeutic when the pathology was relatively minor. The efﬁcacy and resolution of computerized tomographic scanning was great enough that it led to an entirely new genre of nonoperative trauma management for blunt trauma affecting the liver, spleen, pancreas, and kidney, when ongoing bleeding was not a problem.  The 3 changes detailed earlier have led to a decline of 70% to 80% in the incidence of abdominal exploration necessary for trauma management in trauma centers today. Whereas previously surgical residents would commonly document 40 to 50 trauma cases requiring abdominal exploration by completion of training, today the Residency Review Committee for Surgery has lowered the required threshold to 10.  All of the aforementioned changes in disease management have been beneﬁcial to patients and have reduced the magnitude of treatment and the physiological disruption which were previously incident to these disease processes and their treatment. At the same time, they have markedly reduced the experience of surgical residents in performing open abdominal surgery and decreased the breadth of experience they have for multiple disease processes.  IMPACT OF LAPAROSCOPIC SURGERY  The ﬁnal and most signiﬁcant technological change which has occurred is the development of laparoscopic surgery for intra- abdominal surgical management, replacing open surgery and the abdominal incision, which was previously necessary. Laparoscopic surgery arrived on the US scene around 1990 and has expanded steadily since then, as laparoscopic surgical capabilities and instru- mentation have improved. Initially laparoscopic surgery was largely limited to simple procedures such as cholecystectomy, which did not require signiﬁcant amounts of intra-abdominal suturing or perfor- mance of intestinal anastomoses. With steadily increasing experience, the range and complexity of procedures has progressively expanded, and today more complex procedures involving intestinal anastomoses such as laparoscopic colectomy and laparoscopic gastric bypass are routinely performed with low morbidity.  When laparoscopic surgery was introduced to the United States in the 1990s, the academic community was slow to awaken to the rev- olution it represented, slow to adopt laparoscopic surgery in most academic centers, and slow to develop signiﬁcant numbers of fac- ulty who were proﬁcient in its performance. As a result, it advanced more rapidly in the private practice community, often accompanied by a signiﬁcant entrepreneurial element. Surgical faculty in academic centers were often late in acquiring laparoscopic surgery expertise, and as a result, the majority of residents in the early years of its de- velopment were not trained because they had insufﬁcient faculty to act as role models, teachers, and advocates.  The private practice community early on developed private community hospital fellowships, which were not located at academic centers, and began training fellows who had already completed sur- gical training, but were in need of further training in laparoscopy. Such fellowships were outside the Accreditation Council for Gradu- ate Medical Education (ACGME) accreditation system, and did not entail certiﬁcation in a subspecialty deﬁned by the American Board of Medical Specialties (ABMS). Development of this system was enhanced by funding from device manufacturers who sold the equip- ment needed for laparoscopic surgery, and who saw the beneﬁt of expanding the fellowships, which would train surgeons to use the equipment that they manufactured. Funding was generally provided  to pay for the salary of the fellows during their training, and often for other costs of establishing and operating the fellowships. The avail- ability of such funding continues to the present and operates outside any regulatory framework related to surgical education.  Because of the slower development of laparoscopic surgery in the academic community, the paucity of academic faculty who were proﬁcient in laparoscopic surgery, and the development of pri- vate community fellowships in laparoscopic surgery, the training of surgery residents in laparoscopic surgery expanded more slowly than it might have. While the Residency Review Committee (RRC) for Surgery has been steadily increasing the requirements for surgical resident training, it is still the rule that the most complex laparo- scopic surgery is reserved for fellows in postresidency fellowships and not for residents during surgical training, although there is no reason this should be the case.  In summary, the principal change in surgical residency training of the last 20 years has been the loss of many areas of open abdominal surgery, but at the same time, this has not been replaced by a com- parable volume of the same surgery done by complex laparoscopic techniques. Moving this laparoscopic experience back into surgical residency would be possible today, as the deﬁciency in faculty who are proﬁcient in laparoscopic surgery has been fully addressed, but the laparoscopic surgery fellowships which are in competition with residents for cases are already in existence and are maintained in part by external funding unrelated to hospital or educational budgets. Because this entire system operates outside any regulatory frame- work, neither the ACGME nor the ABMS have any control over these fellowships.  IMPACT OF THE 80-HOUR WORKWEEK  The imposition of the 80-hour workweek by the ACGME in 2003 produced a dramatic change in the scheduling of most resident rotations. Although the 80-hour workweek had been recommended previously, it had not been stringently enforced, as it was after 2003, and this necessitated signiﬁcant changes in the scheduling of resident rotations at most centers.  Research before 2003, although not extensive or rigorous in most cases, indicated that surgical residents on average spent 90 to 100 hours per week in the hospital, if their time on night call was included. If a resident spends an average of 100 hours in the hospital for 48 weeks yearly for 5 years, then they have spent approximately 24,000 hours in the hospital during residency. If one does the same calculation for 90-hour workweeks, the time in hospital is 21,600 hours, and for 80 hour-workweeks, it is 19,200 hours. If a resident decreases from 100-hour weeks to 80-hour weeks, the reduction in total hours over 5 years is 4800 hours, and if it decreases from 90 hours to 80 hours, the reduction is 2400 hours. The ﬁrst ﬁgure is equal to 1 year of 100-hour weeks, and the second to 6 months of 100-hour weeks. Thus, the impact of the 80-hour weeks on surgical residents is that it has effectively reduced in-hospital time by 6 months to a year in most programs, a 10% to 20% overall reduction in clinical time.  The time which residents spend on daytime activity, Monday to Friday, has been minimally affected by the 80-hour week, and constitutes the bulk of their clinical experience. One can estimate this daytime weekday commitment as 5 days/week × 12 hours/day = 60 hours/week. The balance of their time is spent on night and weekend duty. Therefore, if they were previously working 100-hour weeks, approximately 40 hours per week was spent on night and weekend responsibilities; if 90 hours/week, 30 hours/week were devoted to night/weekend activity, and with an 80-hour week, 20 hours are so devoted, assuming the daytime weekday responsibilities are invariant. These “back of the napkin” calculations show that the transition from  554 | www.annalsofsurgery.com  C(cid:3) 2012 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins  Copyright © 2012 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

The impact of the 80-hour workweek is therefore that overall resident experience over 5 years of residency is reduced by 6 months to a year of in-hospital experience, and that reduction is principally taken out of night and weekend experience, when residents are more likely to see urgent and emergent conditions, and to have a greater degree of independent functioning, autonomy and indirect supervision, with fewer other residents and faculty on site.  Elective surgical experience doing scheduled nonemergent cases in the operating room has been minimally impacted by the 80-hour week, which is why the numbers often quoted in the liter- ature regarding resident experience seem to show so little change. However, the overall in-hospital experience, and particularly the op- portunity to see and participate in the management of urgent and emergent conditions, has been dramatically impacted, with a roughly estimated reduction of 33% to 50%, which has not been compensated for in other ways. The effect of this on the development of resident self-reliance, clinical judgment, and independent functioning has not been recognized or analyzed but is unquestionably detrimental.  RESIDENT OPINION  The fraction of residents ﬁnishing general surgical residency who continue their training in a postresidency specialty or subspe- cialty fellowship has been steadily increasing for the last 3 decades, and at this time it exceeds 80%. The reasons for this are multiple, but among others is their belief that they are not ready for independent practice and require further training to be competent or competitive in a speciﬁc area of practice. The majority of these fellowships are of a 1-year duration, but many extend 2 or 3 years beyond the 5 years of surgical training.  An extensive survey of resident opinions regarding surgical training was completed by Yeo et al1 and is the most authoritative such survey ever conducted. They obtained input from 4402 surgical residents at all levels of seniority, representing 82% of all categorical residents at the time, from 248 of 249 surgical programs.  Several questions were asked in regard to postresidency spe-  cialty training, as follows:  When presented with the statement “General surgeons must become specialty trained to be successful,” 55% of residents agreed and 26% disagreed (the remainder were neutral).  For the statement “I must complete specialty training to be competi-  tive in the market,” 64% agreed and 21% disagreed.  For the statement “If I complete specialty training I’ll have a better  lifestyle,” 63% agreed and 12% disagreed.  For the statement “If I complete specialty training I’ll have a better  income,” 78% agreed and 7% disagreed.  From these responses, it seems clear that residents feel training beyond residency is necessary if they are to be successful in prac- tice and competitive in the marketplace. Because the job market for general surgeons per se is stronger today than the market for most surgical specialists, these impressions relative to competitiveness and practice success are in fact incorrect, although the conclusions about lifestyle and income may be accurate.  In any case, it is clear that 4 of 5 ﬁnishing general surgery residents, for whatever reason, undertake further training before they enter practice. Thus, for practical purposes, the length of surgical training for more than 80% of surgical residents is 6 to 7 years, not 5 years.  AMERICAN BOARD OF SURGERY EXAMINATION  PERFORMANCE  The American Board of Surgery conducts a written examina- tion after completion of residency primarily focused on the testing of objective knowledge across the breadth of general surgical sub- jects. Upon successful completion, a subsequent oral examination is conducted by 6 independent examiners who are all experienced prac- ticing surgeons, to evaluate clinical management, safety of clinical decision-making, clinical judgment in difﬁcult surgical situations, and management of common complications. The methods of conducting this examination and the grading standards have not changed over an extended period of time.  Failure rates on the written and oral examinations are shown in Figure 1 for the last 20 years. It can be seen that performance on the written examination has been consistent during this time, with no evidence of change. The oral examination, on the other hand, showed the lowest failure rate during a plateau phase from 2002 to 2006, and then began a steady rise to the present time, with an overall increase in the failure rate of 44%.  Although this change correlates with the enforcement of the 80-hour workweek after 2003, and with successive yearly cohorts of residents working within this rubric, it also corresponds to other changes in the surgical environment already described, in particular the increasing role of laparoscopic surgery, and the gradual loss of several areas of open abdominal surgical experience to general surgi- cal residents. Thus, causation cannot be determined for the increase in the oral examination failure rate with any degree of conﬁdence, but it does appear that there has been a decline in residents’ per- ceived abilities in clinical care management, although their overall knowledge of surgical subjects has not changed.  GRADED RESPONSIBILITY, AUTONOMY, AND INDEPENDENT FUNCTIONING IN RESIDENCY  The legal strictures relative to residency training have a logical inconsistency, which has never been adequately addressed. For the  FIGURE 1. American Board of Surgery examination failure rates by year.

One day later, after completing residency, the same resident is legally considered to be “board eligible” and is subsequently “board certiﬁed,” and in both instances is considered to possess sufﬁcient competence to function independently and to manage the full gamut of surgical conditions in all patients without supervision or oversight by anyone else. That such a dramatic enhancement of competence can occur overnight is obviously illogical and fallacious.  What actually occurs, the signal accomplishment of residency training in the United States since the model deﬁned by William Hal- stead in the 1890s, is that surgical residents improve their knowledge and surgical capabilities in a steady fashion throughout 5 years of residency and become progressively more able to manage more in- volved and complex conditions with increasing time. A successful model has evolved in which the hierarchy of residency and faculty oversight, beginning with the attending surgeon who is in charge and extending downward through different levels of resident oversight of other residents, allows the development of progressively more de- tailed knowledge and skills through resident functioning at increas- ing levels of responsibility. Attendings and more senior residents initially teach and oversee more junior residents in the performance of the dozens of skills necessary for patient management, as well as diagnostic evaluation and management; as junior residents become competent in these, they begin to function with a degree of indepen- dence and no longer need direct supervision. During the early years of residency, competence is initially gained in basic skills and simple operations. With increasing experience, diagnostic skills increase and the ability to evaluate and manage more complex diseases evolves. Manual skills in performance of operations increases in parallel with this, and the ability to perform more complex operations similarly evolves, but it is universally accepted in surgical training that it is much more difﬁcult to acquire the diagnostic acumen and surgical judgment needed for independent practice than it is to acquire the manual skills.  Residents may initially learn how to do operations by watching others, but ultimately they must manage patients themselves and do operations themselves if they are to become competent. The American system of resident education is unique in that residency training allows residents to do so while being directly overseen and supervised by attendings who are already competent in the management of patients and performance of operations and who allow residents to manage patients and perform operations while being directly observed and overseen to prevent errors from occurring. The ability of residents to do this in progressively more complex situations is a hallmark of increasing years of experience, and in the ideal residency environment they reach the point where they can do the full spectrum of operations by the completion of residency training.  This system has been negatively impacted by the 80-hour work- week as stated earlier, but additionally by the decline in opportunities for assisting at operations in most training programs, where the op- portunity to watch, before doing, is gained. Longitudinal experience with patients, from preoperative admissions through prolonged post- operative stays have been markedly reduced by the transition from inpatient to outpatient treatment for large numbers of surgical opera- tions. Hernia repair, breast surgery, and cholecystectomy—3 staples of general surgical experience—are all managed primarily as out- patient procedures today, and residents have minimal opportunity to evaluate these patients before surgery or to follow them after- ward to observe their clinical course. It was through more prolonged 556 | www.annalsofsurgery.com  in-hospital stays that residents were exposed to many of the conver- sations about and with patients, where matters instilling judgment, issues around palliation and provision of ethical and compassion- ate care took place. By reductions in work hours and changes in the “typical” in-patient, the opportunities for mentoring and appren- ticeships are reduced, a formerly central component to the training process.  ADDRESSING THE ISSUES  The environmental and technological changes described earlier are irreversible and have fundamentally altered the types of disease that require surgical treatment and the way in which the treatment is done. Such change will undoubtedly continue, and the directions in which surgery will evolve in the future are not predictable. Similarly, the resident’s workweek is not going to return to 100 hours; if anything it is likely to be further shortened, as has happened in Europe. The most effective way in which to address the changes is therefore to look at the things which can be changed in resident training, the many areas in which improvements in resident teaching are possible, and the areas in which residents’ capabilities could be productively expanded.  Deﬁning and Continually Updating the Curriculum  The starting point for making change in residency is to rec- ognize that much of what is being taught is obsolete, and addresses diseases that are no longer a signiﬁcant problem, or those for which surgical treatment is rarely needed. Teaching and testing the extensive amount of information, which exists in regard to gastric physiology, for example, is of little value to current residents who will rarely see a complication of benign peptic ulcer disease. The subjects taught in the curriculum should be continually updated to correspond to med- ical problems which are currently seen and treated, and new areas of technological development should be rapidly incorporated so that residents are kept abreast of current information. Bariatric surgery currently represents the most common operation that is performed in many hospitals, yet residents generally have limited knowledge of the subjects related to the causes of obesity, the physiological changes which occur after bariatric surgery, or the technical details of the var- ious operations performed. In most residencies they have almost no direct operative experience in developing competence in performing the procedures themselves.  There should be a continuous process by which the medical conditions which are currently being treated and the surgical treat- ments administered are tracked and used to modify the teaching cur- riculum to keep residents knowledgeable regarding that which they will be treating presently and as to be fully abreast of current prac- tices. Knowledge related to diseases which are no longer a signiﬁcant problem, while it may be intellectually fascinating in many cases, should be pruned from the active curriculum.  Improving the Efﬁciency of Learning  The general process of teaching residents has changed little in several decades, and is still primarily based on a preceptorship model in which the resident learns about whatever happens to walk through the door of the hospital that day, rather than through a comprehensive curriculum which covers all relevant subjects in a deﬁned period of time, with competency testing at regular intervals to evaluate com- prehension and understanding. The principles of education that are widely known and applied elsewhere are not staples of residency teaching. This in large part is because the service demands placed on residents keep them continually responding to the next signiﬁcant patient care problem throughout the day and prevent structured time from being set aside for didactic teaching. Realistically, the patient care needs which residents provide will never be eliminated but the C(cid:3) 2012 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins  Copyright © 2012 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

Residency training can never be a didactic classroom experi- ence as it is in graduate schools. What could occur, however, is the delivery of a more deﬁned and comprehensive curriculum to residents at an individual level through the multiplicity of handheld devices and small computers, which are available today and usable in any environment. Teaching of residents needs to evolve to a system in which the learning primarily occurs at the individual resident level, rather than via classroom or other group experience, but it should be governed by a structured and deﬁned curriculum which the resident can access in his or her own time frame and in any environment where he or she ﬁnds time available for learning. Numerous studies have shown that the 80-hour workweek has not resulted in increased time reading and studying by trainees. If we wish to change this, the expectations must be more explicitly deﬁned via a curriculum, which outlines speciﬁc levels of achievement by year of residency, and provides low-stakes online methods of self-assessment.  The variety of online and sophisticated resources for learning, including annotated operative videos, the Surgical Council on Resi- dent Education portal and curriculum and other resources make self- directed learning more efﬁcient now than it has ever been. Teaching material could be delivered easily in discrete increments, and could be accompanied by self-assessment upon completion that provides comparative performance data relative to one’s peers, or to an abso- lute standard. The enormous success and rapid growth of the Khan Academy teaching modules (www.khanacademy.com) has demon- strated in the last few years just how dynamic such a model can be, and how effective and attractive it is to users. An almost identical model could be developed for resident learning.  Similarly, maximal learning needs to occur in all available clinical opportunities. This can be achieved in 2 ways. First, to the extent feasible, physician extenders (physician assistants and nurse practitioners) should ofﬂoad the “service” components of resident work so that maximal time for clinical assessments and therapeutic decision-making can be left for the residents, and maximal time for participation in the operating room. Secondly, the teaching faculty in training programs need to understand how to teach more effectively and deliberately. We need to be cognizant of the changes to the case mix that have occurred over the past few decades and train residents deliberately in focused areas. For instance, given the urgent but rare nature of perforated peptic ulcer, residents need to be trained on the principles of gastric surgery on the cases they are seeing in elective situations, such as bariatric surgery. Teaching faculty need to be de- liberate in their goals for each operation they do with trainees, with speciﬁc teaching done in every case. The laparotomy being performed for a cancer resection could and should also include a brief descrip- tion and demonstration of how one might obtain vascular control of traumatic injuries in any number of intra-abdominal organs. Through these deliberate teaching moments, the case at hand can be completed, but the resident can learn two- or threefold from a given case. Teach- ing faculty how to effectively and efﬁciently do this will be crucial. Lastly, we should consider uniform adoption of preresidency “boot camps” (held in the fourth year of medical school) that bring all entering interns to the same level of skill in regard to several basic procedures. In this way, the intern year is maximally spent on devel- opment of skills and attributes unique to surgeons and the often un- derutilized fourth year of medical school can be used to better beneﬁt.  Utilizing Simulation and More Structured Teaching and Assessment  A third improvement in teaching can occur through the de- velopment and use of simulation in focused areas, which allow the C(cid:3) 2012 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins  more rapid accretion of speciﬁc skills, and the ability to objectively assess competence in these areas. The ﬁrst of these to be mandated by the American Board of Surgery is Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery, a course of instruction and assessment developed by the Society of Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons. Completion of Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery at an early stage in resi- dency moves the resident to a standardized threshold of knowledge and skills for laparoscopy and allows him or her to move more con- ﬁdently and rapidly into the utilization of laparoscopy in a variety of operative cases. It ensures that all residents have reached approx- imately the same threshold, and eliminates much of the variability and uncertainty that surrounds such skill acquisition when there is no standardized teaching or testing.  A similar evolution is occurring presently with the Funda- mentals of Endoscopic Surgery, a parallel course developed by Soci- ety of Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons for the teaching of upper and lower gastrointestinal endoscopy skills. When integrated into a complete endoscopic curriculum which speciﬁes clinical ro- tations and experience, it ensures that residents have acquired a baseline competence in performing these skills. This development promises to provide an assurance that residents who complete such training will have achieved a uniform competence in endoscopic performance.  Although still not widely adopted, residents need to receive ex- plicit instruction in basic surgical skills and techniques, which should be practiced in a simulated environment and then tested to proﬁ- ciency. Studies have shown that performance of technical skills im- proves most when practice to deﬁned goals is included; these should be outlined for trainees and rigorously measured. As with Funda- mentals of Laparoscopic Surgery certiﬁcation, if basic surgical skills are mastered early in training, more rapid and conﬁdent adoption of advanced techniques is possible.  Simulators directed toward the teaching of operative skills for speciﬁc operations such as cholecystectomy have been developed, but in general lack a close correspondence to the real thing. Such simulators have never been able to duplicate tissue characteristics in regard to blunt and sharp dissection, nor to simulate bleeding and the methods used for its control. As a result, simulators in this area have never achieved much success other than in teaching manual skill ma- nipulation which is necessary in laparoscopic surgery, intracorporeal suturing, and similar skills which do not require an accurate depiction of tissue manipulation and dissection.  It seems likely that with increasing computer power, the ac- curate replication of tissue characteristics may become possible, and when that occurs it should be feasible to simulate virtually all oper- ative procedures that are done in the abdomen. Such a development would allow for the full development of skills and the presentation of variant anatomy, difﬁcult operative situations, etc, all before an actual encounter with patients.  An area of simulation, which has been attempted by dozens of authors, but has been of limited scope to date has been the attempt to duplicate the diagnostic workup and clinical decision-making, which is at the core of surgical treatment. The ability to conduct a skilled history and physical assessment, formulate a working differential diagnosis, and utilize testing to exclude or establish the correct diag- noses and determine the best treatment remains difﬁcult to teach and is generally learned only through extensive real-world experience. It is often not learned well, and the well-documented errors of com- mission and omission in actual practice clearly indicate the need for improvement. Although this theoretically should be an ideal frame- work in which computer simulation might be of beneﬁt, the ability to accurately mimic in computer programming the complex ways in which information is actually gathered and the processing which occurs in a skilled clinician’s brain has so far eluded programmers, www.annalsofsurgery.com | 557  Copyright © 2012 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins. Unauthorized reproduction of this article is prohibited.  Lewis and Klingensmith  Annals of Surgery r Volume 256, Number 4, October 2012  and the programs which exist only simulate very basic situations and conditions. Even those often have an enforced linearity and lack of logical branching for the multiple scenarios which are present in re- ality, and therefore are of limited value in teaching the needed skills. Improvements in this area are badly needed.  Earlier Specialty Focus in Residency Training  Three “real-world” experiments have been conducted during the last 7 to 8 years in regard to deﬁning the preferences of medical students to undergo the classical model of training for a surgical spe- cialty (5 years of general surgery followed by 1–3 years of specialty fellowship) or to enter instead an “integrated” specialty track directly out of medical school in which the general surgical training is incor- porated into the ﬁrst 3 years of training but seamlessly transitions into the specialty training, which is the ultimate goal of the fellowship. Plastic surgery was the ﬁrst to introduce this model, vascular surgery was the second, and thoracic surgery the third. In plastic surgery, the overall integrated model requires 6 years, the vascular surgery model requires 5 years, and the thoracic surgery model requires 6 years.  In each of these cases, the “integrated” model has proven to be the overwhelming preference of medical students, as evidenced by a dramatic increase in the number of applications for such programs in the internship match. In plastic surgery, this has resulted in a steady increase of such integrated programs and the phasing out of the clas- sical model. In vascular surgery, the number of integrated programs is steadily increasing and now accounts for approximately half of the 120 training programs that exist. In thoracic surgery, the experience is more limited in numbers but appears to have a similar appeal.  This experiment has clearly indicated that for medical students who already have a clear focus on a specialty area for future prac- tice, the 5-year general surgical residency is seen as an unnecessary diversion before getting to their intended area of practice. Concerns remain as to their overall breadth of experience and areas of operative competence, and experience with these programs is not yet sufﬁ- ciently great to know whether graduates in the new paradigms will function equivalently to those who completed the classical programs. However, such concerns are increasingly moot as the overwhelming preference of medical students is driving these developments in an irreversible way.  In recognition of the desire of medical students to focus earlier on the specialty area they hope to practice in, the American Board of Surgery 2 years ago adopted a “ﬂexibility” option in regard to resi- dency training in which an individual resident could spend 12 months during the last 3 years of residency focused on a single specialty area. It was intended that beginning in the third year and extend- ing through the fourth and ﬁfth years a resident could accumulate 12 months of experience in a specialty before actually entering that specialty after residency. Such experience would allow them to enter fellowship with signiﬁcantly enhanced knowledge of the ﬁeld, and to progress more rapidly during the 1 to 3 years of fellowship training. Utilization of this option by program directors has been limited to date, but it remains an option that can be used to allow residents to focus earlier on more specialized training during general surgical residency.  Expanded Laparoscopic Surgery Training  In the earlier discussion, it was noted that overall, surgical res- idents have lost signiﬁcant operative experience in open abdominal surgery, but that this has not been replaced with comparable experi- ence doing more complex laparoscopic abdominal surgery, in part due to the development of laparoscopic surgery fellowships. Although the RRC for Surgery has mandated gradually increasing complexity and  volume of laparoscopic surgery, the requirements are still modest in regard to the breadth and complexity of laparoscopic procedures done in practice today.  There is no intrinsic reason why the requirements for breadth and volume of laparoscopic surgery during residency should not steadily increase to correct this deﬁciency. The initial lack of fac- ulty with sufﬁcient experience to teach the laparoscopic procedures has been long since corrected, and the skills of fourth- and ﬁfth-year surgical residents are essentially the same as the fellows 1 year their senior who enter the laparoscopic fellowships. Making this transi- tion would require the coordinated efforts of department chairs and program directors, but overall it would strengthen and expand the capabilities of graduating residents.  Increasing Length of Residency  The time which has effectively been lost from residency be- cause of the 80-hour workweek was noted earlier to be in the range of 6 to 12 months of in-hospital experience, largely in the urgent and emergent experience that occurs at night and on weekends. The only ways to compensate for this and achieve the same level of ﬁnal training is to either train more efﬁciently, which has already been described, or to increase the length of residency. When the question of increasing time in residency is raised, the immediate reaction is generally that this would not be possible, because the present 5-year residency is already often viewed as too long. However, this over- looks the fact that more than 80% of surgical residents already elect to take a postresidency fellowship in a specialty or subspecialty area. Most of these fellowships are 1 year in length, whereas several of them are 2 years (vascular surgery, pediatric surgery, surgical oncol- ogy, transplantation) and some are 3 years (thoracic surgery, plastic surgery). Thus, any discussion of extending residency only applies to the 20% of residents who currently complete only general surgical residency and do not seek subspecialty training. Extending residency by 1 year to obtain more extensive training in general surgery per se would not seem to be an insurmountable issue if the beneﬁts clearly warranted it.  The method by which training might be increased is open to considerable debate. Currently a few of the additional fellowships are subject to accreditation by the ACGME (vascular surgery, pediatric surgery, surgical critical care, hand surgery) but the majority are not. The other specialty fellowships are generally overseen by surgical specialty societies, and the degree of standardization and rigor in the oversight process is variable. Nevertheless, most of these fellow- ships seem to function effectively in providing the expected specialty training, and complaints are almost never heard from fellows who complete them that their training was insufﬁcient or inadequate. Be- cause no examinations are given for these nonaccredited fellowships, nor are other assessments made, we have no objective data in regard to differences in quality of training in different fellowships, or of overall competence gained in the speciﬁc area of training.  A characteristic of the fellowships which follows from the fact that the fellow is board eligible or board certiﬁed is that he or she is legally entitled to function independently in patient care and does not need documented oversight for all of their clinical activities as residents do. This allows the fellow to have a degree of conditional independence and to develop conditional autonomy as their skills dictate, and this has made the fellowships attractive to surgeons who ﬁnd similar experience lacking in residency today. There has been no systematic study of the effect of this greater degree of autonomy, nor has there been any comparison of the performance of surgeons who have completed fellowship versus residency only in this regard, but it is an effective way of obtaining a period of training in which some independence and autonomy is available.  558 | www.annalsofsurgery.com  C(cid:3) 2012 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins  Copyright © 2012 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

Adding Additional Skills to Surgical Residency Training  The ﬁnal area in which surgical residency might be strength- ened is in the addition of technical skills which are not presently taught, but which would allow surgeons to provide more uniﬁed and comprehensive treatment for the patients they already see. One such area is the use of ultrasound for better diagnosis of conditions in breast, endocrine, vascular, and trauma diseases. This is currently done in many programs, but there are no standardized requirements established by the RRC. A second is the use of interventional catheter techniques for the diagnosis or treatment of a variety of conditions. Vascular surgery has expanded their abilities in use of catheter tech- niques in the last 15 years in a dramatic way to increase the endovas- cular capabilities of their specialty. General surgery has not done this, but there are a number of conditions in which simple catheter techniques might be used for more efﬁcient treatment of surgical dis- ease. Consideration should be given to the more uniform teaching and testing of such targeted skills, where it would make uniﬁed disease management more effective and efﬁcient.  SUMMARY  The practice of general surgery has undergone a marked evo- lution in the last 20 years, which has been inadequately recognized and minimally addressed. The changes that have occurred have been disruptive to residency training, and to date there has been mini- mal compensation for these. Evidence is now emerging of signiﬁcant issues in the overall performance of recent graduates from at least 3 sources-–the evaluation of external agents who incorporate these graduates into their practice or group, the opinions of the residents themselves, and the performance of graduates on the oral examina- tion of the American Board of Surgery during the last 8 years. The environmental and technological causes of this situation represent improvements in care for patients and are clearly irreversible. Hence, solutions to the problems must be sought in other areas. The problems brought about by the 80-hour workweek are somewhat different and dictate that more efﬁcient and perhaps additional training is needed. To address the issues effectively, greater recognition and engagement is needed by the surgical community so that effective solutions can be crafted.  REFERENCE  1. Yeo H, Viola K, Berg D, et al.

In elderly patients,  who often have a poor nutrition status, this relationship has not been substantiated. Thus, the aim of this systematic review was to assess the  merit of preoperative nutrition parameters used to predict postoperative outcome in elderly patients undergoing general surgery. Methods:  A  systematic  literature  search  of  10  consecutive  years,  1998–2008,  in  PubMed,  EMBASE,  and  Cochrane  databases  was  performed.  Search terms used were nutrition status, preoperative assessment, postoperative outcome, and surgery (hip or general), including their  synonyms and MeSH terms. Limits used in the search were human studies, published in English, and age (65 years or older). Articles were  screened using inclusion and exclusion criteria. All selected articles were checked on methodology and graded. Results: Of 463 articles  found, 15 were included. They showed profound heterogeneity in the parameters used for preoperative nutrition status and postoperative  outcome. The only significant preoperative predictors of postoperative outcome in elderly general surgery patients were serum albumin  and ≥10% weight loss in the previous 6 months. Conclusions: This systematic review revealed only 2 preoperative parameters to predict  postoperative outcome in elderly general surgery patients: weight loss and serum albumin. Both are open to discussion in their use as  a preoperative nutrition parameter. Nonetheless, serum albumin seems a reliable preoperative parameter to identify a patient at risk for  nutrition deterioration and related complicated postoperative course. (JPEN J Parenter Enteral Nutr. 2013;37:37-43)  Keywords preoperative status; preoperative assessment; postoperative outcome; nutrition status, elderly; surgery  Clinical Relevancy Statement  This systematic review shows that only two parameters, pre- operative serum albumin and weight loss, have been linked to  postoperative outcome in the elderly general surgery patient.  They  may  not  strictly  be  seen  as  nutritional  indicators,  but  clearly they are linked to severity of disease, which probably  explains their value in predicting postoperative complications  in the elderly general surgery patient. The lack of evidence on  the relation between objective preoperative nutritional param- eters and postoperative outcome is surprising, because of the  growing interest in nutritional supplementation in the elderly.  Therefore,  there  is  room  for  improvement  when  it  comes  to  defining nutritional status and its role in predicting outcome in  the elderly surgical patient. In the meantime, serum albumin  and weight loss can be used as reliable preoperative nutritional  parameters for predicting postoperative outcome in the elderly  general surgery patient.  Introduction The  number  of  elderly  people  in  need  of  surgery  is  steadily  growing, creating a medical and economic challenge. A focus  on  optimizing  their  preoperative  medical  condition  might   improve  postoperative  outcome  and  reduce  costs  in  these  patients. One of these measures may be nutrition intervention  to  improve  preoperative  nutrition  status. To  achieve  this,  we  should be able to determine adequately the preoperative nutri- tion status to undertake preventive measures.  The  elderly  patient  differs,  among  other  things,  from  younger adult patients in their reduced adaptive and regen- erative  capacity,  making  rehabilitation  a  profound  chal- lenge.1,2 Advanced age in itself is independently associated  with poor nutrition status in admitted patients and is a sig- nificant  predictor  of  postoperative  mortality  in  surgical  patients.3-5  The  poor  nutrition  status  in  the  elderly  is  explained  by  low  nutrient  intake,  less  access  to  adequate   From 1Department of Surgery, 2Medical Library, 3Department of  Biostatistics, Medical Center Alkmaar, Alkmaar, The Netherlands, and  4VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.

This association has already been established in  the adult patient population.3,7-13 Furthermore, in adult patients,  improvement in clinical outcome by nutrition intervention was  highest in patients who were nutritionally at risk.14  To be able to identify reliable preoperative nutrition status  parameters for the elderly patient that can eventually be used  for preventive measures, the aim of the present study was to  systematically review the available evidence on the relation- ship  between  preoperative  nutrition  status  and  postoperative  outcome in the elderly general surgery patient.  741 Articles identified  278 Articles overlapping  463 Articles screened  448 Articles excluded: 312  not meeting the inclusion criteria   53  other than general surgery   52  poor/not defined preoperative nutritional status   24  no outcome criteria    1  only immune function as outcome    3  non responding author (e.g. no age criteria in article)    2  no original data included    1  no full text available   Methods Data Sources  15 Articles included  Figure 1. Flowchart of study inclusion.  Relevant articles from 10 consecutive years, 1998–2008, were  identified by using the electronic databases PubMed, Cochrane,  and EMBASE. Search terms used were nutrition status, preop- erative  assessment,  postoperative  outcome,  and  surgery  (hip  or  general),  including  their  synonyms  and  MeSH  terms.  Limits  used  in  the  search  were  human  studies,  published  in  English, and age (65 years or older). The full search strategy  can be requested from the corresponding author.  Data Selection  The articles were screened for eligibility by 2 reviewers sepa- rately, by reading the article abstract or full text. Inclusion crite- ria were as follows: age (65 years or older), published between  1998 and 2008 in English, general or hip surgery, and a relation  between  preoperative  nutrition  status  and  postoperative  out- come. Exclusion criteria were as follows: poor/not defined pre- operative  nutrition  status,  no  outcome  criteria,  other  types  of  surgery than hip or general surgery (eg, gynecological, cardio- thoracic,  transplant,  ear/nose/throat,  urological,  neurosurgery),  preoperative  immune  function  measurements,  nonresponding  author (when extra information was needed: eg, full text or age  criteria),  and  no  original  data  included.  Where  discordance  existed between the 2 reviewers, a joint decision was made.  Data Evaluation  A methodology checklist for cohort studies, produced by the  National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE),  April 2007, was used to grade for quality.15 The methodologi- cal check was done separately by 2 reviewers. Discordances  between the reviewers were found using cross-tabs and the χ2  test.  Both  reviewers,  separate  from  each  other,  checked  the  discordances for appropriateness. The remaining discordances  were debated until a joint decision was made.  The  final  data  were  put  in  a  new  database,  and  all  items  were  set  into  comparable  digit  ordinal  variables  (per  item  a  minimum of 1, maximum of 5; “not applicable” was set as 0)  to be able to make a grading. The grading was subjected to a  reliability analysis to verify for dissonant items in the check- list.  In  addition,  a  regression  analysis  was  done  to  analyze  which items were more or less of an influence on the grading. The  2  sections  of  the  checklist  were  analyzed  separately  because they differ: section 1 is about the internal validity of  the study, and section 2 concerns the overall assessment of the  study.  Ultimately,  a  final  grade  was  given  per  section  of  the  checklist. When only worst scores per item were given, grade  1 should be given, and when only best scores per item were  given,  grade  10  should  be  given.  This  led  to  the  following  equations  per  section:  for  section  1,  the  final  grade  =  10  –  [(“sum of items section 1” – 11)/(74/9)], and for section 2, the  final grade = 10 – [(“sum of items section 2” – 3)/2].  Results Study Characteristics  The  search  resulted  in  a  total  of  741  articles.  The  overlap  between  the  search  databases  was  278  articles,  leaving  463  articles for screening. Fifteen articles were considered eligible  for  the  review  (Figure  1).  These  articles  could  be  separated  into 2 groups: patients with hip surgery (Table 1) and patients  with other types of general surgery (Table 2).  Data Evaluation  The  reliability  analysis  on  the  grading  of  the  methodology  checklist resulted in a Cronbach’s α of 0.702 on section 1, for  which 3 items had to be deleted (items 1.4, 1.5, and 1.12).

Because item 2.1 is considered an important  item, it was decided to accept the lower Cronbach’s α. In addi- tion, the regression analysis on section 2 revealed no less or  more  important  items. The  final  grades  on  both  sections  are  presented in Tables 1 and 2.  Postoperative Outcome  The outcome parameters used in the 15 included articles could  easily  be  divided  into  4  categories:  postoperative  complica- tions, mortality, length of hospital stay, and other postopera- tive  parameters.  The  outcome  parameters  will  be  addressed  using  these  categories  to  simplify  the  presentation  of  the  results.  Postoperative complications. Five of the 15 included arti- cles described a relation between preoperative nutrition param- eters and postoperative complications.16-20  In detail, 4 studies studied serum albumin as a preoperative  predictor of postoperative complications. In the study by Koval et  al,16 serum albumin was not found to be predictive of complica- tions in general. In contrast, however, the other 3 studies showed  that  low  serum  albumin  significantly  predicted  postoperative  complications (complications in general, P = .01919; nosocomial  infections, P = .00817; pressure ulcers, P = .00817; delirium, P =  .0218). Koval et al16 defined low serum albumin as serum albumin  <35 g/L, Formiga et al17 and Ganai et al18 as serum albumin <30  g/L, and Bozzetti et al19 as serum albumin ≤30 g/L.  Three studies used total lymphocyte count (TLC) as a pre- operative predictor. In 1 study, TLC was a significant predictor  of postoperative complications (pressure ulcers, P = .0217) but  not  in  3  studies  (complications  in  general,16,19  nosocomial  infections17).  In 1 study, weight loss ≥10% in the previous 6 months was  a significant preoperative predictor of postoperative complica- tions in general (P = .019).19  No  significance  was  reported  for  cholesterol  (nosocomial  infections and pressure ulcers17), Mini-Nutrition Assessment– Short  Form  (MNA-SF;  nosocomial  infections  and  pressure    19412444, 2013, 1, Downloaded from https://aspenjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1177/0148607112445900 by University Of Ottawa Library, Wiley Online Library on [06/02/2023].

Mortality.  Eight  of  the  15  included  articles  described   a  relation  between  preoperative  nutrition  parameters  and  mortality.16-18,21-25  In detail, 7 studies used serum albumin as a preoperative  predictor of mortality. In 5 studies, low serum albumin was a  significant predictor of mortality (in-hospital mortality16,18,21:  P = .0316, P = .0418 odds ratio [OR] = 6.82, 95% confidence  interval [CI] = 1.56–29.72, P = .01121; <6-month mortality25:  P  = .0525; 6-month mortality21: OR = 2.59, 95% CI = 1.20– 5.60, P = .01621; 12-month mortality21,24: OR = 2.32, 95% CI =  1.09–4.92, P = .029,21 and OR = 5.59, 95% CI = 1.57–19.97,  P = .0824), but in 2 studies, it was not significant (in-hospital  mortality,17 mortality in general23). See the definitions, listed  earlier, of low serum albumin used by Koval et al,16 Formiga et  al,17 and Ganai et al.18 Pioli et al21 defined low serum albumin  as  serum  albumin  <30  g/L,  Girvent  et  al23  and  Symeonidis   et  al24  as  serum  albumin  <35  g/L,  and  Nair  et  al25  as  serum  albumin <28 g/L.  Three studies used TLC as a preoperative predictor of mor- tality. In 1 study, TLC was a significant predictor (12-month  mortality: OR = 2.5, 95% CI = 1.3–4.9, P < .0116) but not in 2  studies (in-hospital mortality17,25).  Two studies combined serum albumin and TLC as a preop- erative predictor. In both studies, patients with low serum albu- min and low TLC preoperatively were more likely to die within  12  months  after  surgery  than  patients  with  normal  levels  of  both parameters (OR = 3.5, 95% CI = 1.2–10.2, P = .0216; OR  = 3.02, 95% CI = 1.11–8.27, P = .03124).  In  1  study,  dietary  intake  was  not  significantly  related  to   12-month mortality.22  Two studies described triceps skin fold thickness (TSF) as a  preoperative predictor of mortality. TSF was a significant pre- dictor in one of these studies (12-month mortality: P < .0122)  but not in the other (in-hospital mortality25).  Nonsignificant preoperative predictors of in-hospital mor- tality  were  cholesterol,17,25  MNA-SF,17  body  mass  index  (BMI),25 and muscle mid-arm circumference (MMC).25  Length of hospital stay. Four of the 15 included studies  showed a relation between preoperative nutrition status and  length of stay (LOS). In detail, 3 studies used serum albumin  as  a  preoperative  predictor  of  LOS.  In  all  3  studies,  low  serum albumin was a predictor of prolonged LOS (OR = 1.9,  95% CI = 1.1–3.4; P = .03,16 P = .001,18 and P = .00223). In  1  study,  low  TLC  was  not  significantly  associated  with  LOS.16 Two studies combined serum albumin and TLC as a  preoperative  predictor  of  LOS.  Patients  with  a  low  serum  albumin and low TLC were more likely to have a prolonged  LOS  than  patients  with  normal  levels  of  both  parameters  (OR = 2.9, 95% CI = 1.1–7.8, P = .0316; OR = 2.78, 95% CI =  0.95–8.16, P = .06224).  Other postoperative outcome parameters. Six of the 15  included studies used other postoperative outcome parameters   than postoperative complications, mortality, and LOS in asso- ciation with preoperative nutrition parameters.  Two studies had postoperative energy intake as a postopera- tive outcome parameter. Low serum albumin (P = .03)26 was a  significant  preoperative  nutrition  parameter  associated  with  decreased postoperative energy intake, but BMI26,27 was not a  significant preoperative nutrition parameter.  One study had postoperative protein intake as a postopera- tive  outcome  parameter,  which  was  not  significantly  associ- ated with preoperative BMI.27  Another  study  used  body  mass  density  at  6  months  as  a  postoperative  outcome  parameter.  Weight  and  insulin-like  growth  factor  1  (IGF-1)  combined  significantly  influenced  body  mass  density  at  6  months  (P  =  .02),  but  insulin-like  growth factor binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3) did not.28  IGF-1 level at 1 month, as a postoperative outcome param-  eter, was associated with low preoperative BMI (P < .05).29  In 1 study, the postoperative outcome parameter used was  functional outcome, which was defined as regaining prefrac- ture level of activities of daily living (ADL) at 12 months or  as  regaining  prefracture  level  of  instrumental  activities  of  daily living (IADL) at 12 months. Patients with a low serum  albumin  were  less  likely  to  regain  their  prefracture  level  of  ADL at 12 months (OR = 3.4, 95% CI = 1.8–6.5, P < .001),  whereas  serum  albumin  was  not  predictive  for  recovery  of  IADL at 12 months.16  One study used the same markers as the preoperative nutri- tion parameter and postoperative outcome parameter. However,  weight, TSF, mid-arm circumference (MAC), and MNA were  not predictive of weight, TSF, MAC, and MNA 7 days after  surgery.30  Discussion Considering the relevance of the question, we were surprised  by  the  small  number  of  studies  addressing  the  relationship  between  preoperative  nutrition  status  and  postoperative  out- come in the elderly general surgery patient. Many studies did  assess preoperative nutrition status and postoperative outcome  without investigating their relationship. The 15 included arti- cles are quite heterogeneous in the parameters used for preop- erative  nutrition  status  and  postoperative  outcome.  This  systematic  review  detected  only  2  preoperative  nutrition  parameters to predict postoperative outcome in elderly general  surgery patients: serum albumin and weight loss in the previ- ous 6 months. These preoperative nutrition parameters will be  discussed here.  In the selected articles, serum albumin is the most used pre- operative nutrition parameter. Low serum albumin was a sig- nificant preoperative predictor of postoperative complications  and postoperative mortality in most articles16-19,21,23-25 but not  in all.16,17,23 Low serum albumin predicted prolonged LOS in  all articles.16,18,23 This might show that serum albumin can be a  reliable predictor of postoperative outcome in elderly general  surgery patients.   19412444, 2013, 1, Downloaded from https://aspenjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1177/0148607112445900 by University Of Ottawa Library, Wiley Online Library on [06/02/2023].

In patients with hip frac- ture (aged >60 years), O’Daly et al31 showed that preoperative  low  serum  albumin  negatively  influenced  12-month  survival  after surgery. Gibbs et al32 also showed that serum albumin can  be seen as a predictor of postoperative outcome being related  to 30-day postoperative mortality. Lohsiriwat et al33 and Kudsk  et  al34  found  that  low  serum  albumin  is  associated  with  the  occurrence of postoperative complications.  These  findings  indicate  that  determining  preoperative  serum albumin has value in predicting postoperative outcome.  However, it is questionable whether serum albumin is a good  representative  of  nutrition  status.  In  general,  it  is  advocated  that serum albumin should not be seen as a nutrition parameter  but  rather  as  a  marker  of  inflammatory  metabolism.35-39  Nonetheless, serum albumin might be used to identify the sick- est patients, who, as a consequence, are also at risk for nutri- tion deterioration.36  In one study, ≥10% weight loss in the previous 6 months  was predictive of postoperative complications.19 This is in line  with the study by Pronio et al,40 who even found that patients  with a weight loss ≤10% in the previous 6 months, undergoing  major  abdominal  surgery,  had  a  significantly  higher  rate  of  postoperative  complications  compared  with  patients  with  no  weight loss in the previous 6 months. In contrast, Skipworth et  al41 and Han-Geurts et al42 found that preoperative weight loss  did not predict the occurrence of postoperative complications  in nonelderly adult patients undergoing major surgery. Weight  loss in the previous 6 months might be an indicator of postop- erative outcome, but the current evidence is based on a single  study and therefore considered marginal.  The difficulty with assessing nutrition status is exemplified  by  the  recommendations  of  European  Society  for  Clinical  Nutrition and Metabolism (ESPEN) and American Society for  Parenteral  and  Enteral  Nutrition  (A.S.P.E.N.)  with  respect  to  which screening tool may be used. ESPEN advocated the MNA  as a nutrition screening tool and as an outcome predictor in the  elderly patient. In addition, Murphy et al43 and Cohendy et al44  found that the MNA seems useful in the preoperative evaluation  of nutrition status in elderly patients. However, the MNA is still  not frequently used as a tool to predict outcome.45  In  a  recent  clinical  guideline  of  A.S.P.E.N.  on  nutrition  screening and assessment, the elderly are not mentioned sepa- rately but integrated in the adult population.39 In another clini- cal guideline of A.S.P.E.N. on enteral and parenteral nutrition  use, a special section on the elderly is found.46 In both guide- lines,  nutrition  screening  is  recommended  but  with  different  grades. The A.S.P.E.N. clinical guideline on nutrition screen- ing and assessment does not recommend one assessment over  the  other.39  However,  the  other  guideline,  recognizing  the  absence of a validated screening tool, suggests using the sub- jective global assessment (SGA).46 Scientifically, the value of  the MNA, SGA, and other screening tools has been questioned  by  Jones.47  Jones  critically  evaluated  the  methodology  of   published  nutrition  assessment  and  screening  tools  and  con- cluded that none of these screening tools satisfied a set of cri- teria regarding scientific merit.  This systematic review shows that only 2 parameters, pre- operative serum albumin and weight loss, have been linked to  postoperative outcome in the elderly general surgery patient.  Unfortunately,  the  evidence  for  weight  loss  is  marginal. The  evidence  for  serum  albumin  is  more  substantiated,  although  serum albumin cannot be considered a true nutrition parame- ter.  Still,  there  is  room  for  improvement  when  it  comes  to  defining nutrition status and its role in predicting outcome in  the elderly surgical patient.  References   1.

Sheetz, MD, MSc; Jake Claflin, BS; Justin B. Dimick, MD, MPH  Abstract  IMPORTANCE Increasing use of robotic surgery for common surgical procedures with limited evidence and unclear clinical benefit is raising concern. Analyses of population-based trends in practice and how hospitals’ acquisition of robotic surgical technologies is associated with their use are limited.  OBJECTIVE To characterize trends in the use of robotic surgery for common surgical procedures.  DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This cohort study used clinical registry data from Michigan from January 1, 2012, through June 30, 2018. Trends were characterized in the use of robotic surgery for common procedures for which traditional laparoscopic minimally invasive surgery was already considered a safe and effective approach for most surgeons when clinically feasible. A multigroup interrupted time series analysis was performed to determine how procedural approaches (open, laparoscopic, and robotic) change after hospitals launch a robotic surgery program. Data were analyzed from March 1 through April 19, 2019.  EXPOSURES Initiation of robotic surgery.  MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Procedure approach (ie, robotic, open, or laparoscopic).  RESULTS The study cohort included 169 404 patients (mean [SD] age, 55.4 [16.9] years; 90 595 women [53.5%]) at 73 hospitals. The use of robotic surgery increased from 1.8% in 2012 to 15.1% in 2018 (8.4-fold increase; slope, 2.1% per year; 95% CI, 1.9%-2.3%). For certain procedures, the magnitude of the increase was greater; for example, for inguinal hernia repair, the use of robotic surgery increased from 0.7% to 28.8% (41.1-fold change; slope, 5.4% per year; 95% CI, 5.1%-5.7%). The use of robotic surgery increased 8.8% in the first 4 years after hospitals began performing robotic surgery (2.8% per year; 95% CI, 2.7%-2.9%). This trend was associated with a decrease in laparoscopic surgery from 53.2% to 51.3% (difference, −1.9%; 95% CI, −2.2% to −1.6%). Before adopting robotic surgery, hospitals’ use of laparoscopic surgery increased 1.3% per year. After adopting robotic surgery, the use of laparoscopic surgery declined 0.3% (difference in trends, −1.6%; 95% CI, −1.7% to −1.5%).  CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE These results suggest that robotic surgery has continued to diffuse across a broad range of common surgical procedures. Hospitals that launched robotic surgery programs had a broad and immediate increase in the use of robotic surgery, which was associated with a decrease in traditional laparoscopic minimally invasive surgery.  JAMA Network Open. 2020;3(1):e1918911. doi:10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2019.18911  Key Points Question Given concerns that robotic surgery is increasing for common surgical procedures with limited evidence and unclear clinical benefit, how is the use of robotic surgery changing over time?  Findings In this cohort study of 169 404 patients in 73 hospitals, the use of robotic surgery for all general surgery procedures increased from 1.8% to 15.1% from 2012 to 2018. Hospitals that launched robotic surgery programs had a broad and immediate increase in the use of robotic surgery, which was associated with a decrease in traditional laparoscopic minimally invasive surgery.

However, concerns have been raised that robotic surgery is more costly1,2 and may be no more effective3,4 than other established operative approaches, such as traditional laparoscopic minimally invasive and open surgery. With respect to costs, for example, robotic surgery has been associated with episode costs as much as 25% higher compared with laparoscopic surgery. There are also concerns about the rapid growth of robotic surgery in areas with limited evidence to support its use and little theoretical benefit or clinical rationale (eg, inguinal hernia repair). The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently issued a warning against the use of robotic surgery for the treatment of breast and cervical cancers.5 In their communication, they expressed concerns about the lack of epidemiologic data characterizing the use of robotic surgery in real-world practice settings. Current estimates are limited to single-center studies,6-8 device manufacturers’ financial statements,9 and claims data, which may be inaccurate owing to unreliable coding.10,11 We used population-based data from a manually abstracted statewide clinical registry to characterize contemporary trends in the adoption of robotic surgery across a range of general surgical procedures, which now represent the largest market for the technology in the United States.  Methods Data Source and Study Population This cohort study used data from the Michigan Surgical Quality Collaborative (MSQC), an Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality–recognized patient safety organization. The MSQC represents a voluntary partnership between 73 Michigan hospitals and Blue Cross/Blue Shield of Michigan that focuses on clinical quality improvement for surgical care. Hospitals participating in the MSQC perform more than 90% of all surgical procedures in Michigan. The MSQC maintains a clinical registry using a standardized data collection platform, validated case-sampling methods, and trained nurse data abstractors at each participating site. Data accuracy is maintained through rigorous training, internal data audits, and annual site visits by MSQC program staff. This data source allowed us to identify robotic procedures with greater precision and accuracy than is possible using claims data. This study was approved by the University of Michigan institutional review board, which deemed the study exempt from informed consent owing to use of secondary data. This study was designed and reported in adherence to the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) reporting guideline.  We used data from the complete MSQC clinical registry file to identify all inpatient and  outpatient general surgical episodes from January 1, 2012, through June 30, 2018. Procedures were identified and categorized by Current Procedural Terminology codes. We focused on general surgical procedures, which represent the clinical domain with the largest growth in robotic surgery. These files include additional information on patient age, demographic characteristics, and comorbid conditions in addition to detailed procedural information (eg, operative approach and anesthesia type), postoperative complications, death, and resource use (readmissions and emergency department visits).  Outcomes Our primary outcome of interest was the surgical approach—robotic, laparoscopic, or open. The MSQC data were manually abstracted, and data on surgical approach were derived directly from the operative reports rather than procedural codes. Procedures were considered robotic if surgeons reported using the surgical robot in their operative report. Cases in which a robotic procedure was unexpectedly converted to another approach (eg, conversion to open procedure for bleeding) were characterized as robotic because this was the original approach chosen by the surgeon.

The purpose of this analysis was to characterize trends in the use of surgical approaches over time for common general surgical procedures. We first reported raw proportions that were not adjusted for patient or hospital characteristics. We evaluated trends by calculating the fold change in each approach over time by dividing the proportional use of robotic surgery in 2018 by the proportional use in 2012. We also calculated the annual increase or decrease in the proportional use of each approach using linear regression. The coefficient for study years, modeled as a continuous variable, is reported as the annual trend. We then replicated the overall analysis stratified by specific procedures to determine whether overall trends were influenced by changes in practice for certain procedures.  To determine how hospitals change their practices after they begin performing robotic surgery,  we performed a multigroup interrupted time series analysis. During the study period, 23 of the 73 MSQC participating hospitals (31.5%) began performing robotic surgery (32 hospitals were already performing robotic surgery at the time that MSQC began collecting data on this approach in 2012). We determined the date of the first robotic general surgery procedure within each of the hospitals that adopted robotic surgery during the study period. We then centered all hospitals on this date and evaluated the trends in the proportional use of each approach in the years before and after the hospital performed its first robotic operation. We used linear splines to model absolute levels and trends in the periods before and after introduction of robotic surgery. This analysis was designed to  Table 1.

Our primary analysis was not adjusted for specific procedures, but we generated estimates for each procedure group in a sensitivity analysis. We estimated cluster-robust standard errors to account for repeated observations within hospitals. We performed all statistical analyses using Stata, version 14.2 statistical software (StataCorp LLC).  Results Characteristics for the 169 404 patients and 73 hospitals are included in Table 1. The mean (SD) age for all patients was 55.4 (16.9) years; 90 595 (53.5%) were women and 78 809 (46.5%) were men. Cholecystectomy was the most common operation (62 854 [37.1%]). Of the 73 hospitals included in the study, 31 (42.5%) had fewer than 200 beds and 11 (15.1%) had at least 500 beds. Sixty-two hospitals (84.9%) were teaching hospitals, and the mean (SD) total surgical volume was 12 068 (10 933) cases.  From January 2012 through June 2018, the use of robotic surgery for all general surgery  procedures increased from 1.8% to 15.1% (8.4-fold change; slope, 2.1% per year; 95% CI, 1.9%-2.3%) (Figure 1 and Table 2). During the same period, the use of both laparoscopic and open surgery declined. For example, the proportional use of open surgery was 42.4% in 2012 compared with 32.4% in 2018 (0.8-fold change; slope, −1.5% per year; 95% CI, −1.8% to −1.2%) (eTable 1 and eTable 2 in the Supplement). Trends in robotic surgery use were similar for specific procedures, although for some, the magnitude of the increase was greater. For example, the use of robotic surgery for inguinal hernia repair increased from 0.7% to 28.8% from January 2012 through June 2018 (41.1-fold change; slope, 5.4% per year; 95% CI, 5.1%-5.7%).

For example, 8.7% of surgeons performed robotic general surgery in 2012 compared with 35.1% in 2018 (eFigure in the Supplement). During the study period, 23 hospitals (31.5%) began performing robotic surgery. In those hospitals, the use of robotic surgery increased from 3.1% in the first year to 13.1% in the fourth year after hospitals began performing robotic general surgery operations (overall mean in first 4 years, 8.8%; slope, 2.8% per year; difference, 2.8% [95% CI, 2.7%-2.9%]) (Figure 2 and Table 3). The use of laparoscopic surgery decreased from 53.2% to 51.3% after hospitals began performing robotic surgery (difference, −1.9%; 95% CI, −2.2% to −1.6%) (Table 3). Before hospitals performed robotic surgery, a trend toward greater use of laparoscopic surgery occurred (slope, 1.3% per year). A trend toward less laparoscopic surgery after hospitals began performing robotic surgery occurred (slope, −0.3% per year; difference, −1.6%; 95% CI, −1.7% to −1.5%). Results remained the same when stratified across specific procedures.  Discussion This study used a unique, clinically oriented, and manually abstracted data source to characterize the use of robotic surgery across a wide range of common general surgical procedures. These data identify the correct procedure approach with greater precision and accuracy than claims. We found that the use of robotic surgery increased dramatically from 2012 to 2018. Although the use of robotic surgery increased across all procedures, for certain operations, such as inguinal hernia repair, practice patterns shifted by an order of magnitude toward greater use of robotics. We also found that the use of robotic surgery increased rapidly and diffused widely across numerous different procedures in the years after hospitals begin performing robotic surgery. This trend was associated with a decrease in the use of open and laparoscopic minimally invasive procedures, which for most surgeons was already considered a safe and effective approach when clinically feasible.  Recent work suggests that the United States now performs more robotic surgery than any other country in the world, although overall trends in other specialties (eg, urology) toward greater use of robotic surgery have been present for many years.9 Based on robotic device manufacturers’ financial statements, procedure volumes exceeded 600 000 in 2017, with the largest and fastest growing contributor being the field of general surgery.9 This finding suggests that the clinical footprint for robotic surgery will continue to increase as it has for more than a decade already. However, accurate data on how robotic surgery is being applied in contemporary practice is lacking. Prior studies are limited to single-center reports and claims-based analyses that may be inaccurate owing to unreliable coding.6-8,10,11 This inaccuracy is problematic because it may limit our ability to understand the clinical  Figure 2.

From 2012 to 2018, 23 of 73 hospitals (31.5%) in the Michigan Surgical Quality Collaborative started performing robotic general surgery. These data are restricted to those hospitals.

It also limits the ability of policy makers and regulators to scope oversight or, more broadly, the public health implications of rapid changes in surgical practice.  Within this context, regulators from the FDA recently expressed safety concerns about the  rapidly growing use of robotic approaches for certain cancer operations.5 These concerns stem from the limited evidence of benefit (eg, fewer complications or better oncologic resection quality) for robotic surgery. For example, randomized clinical trials have failed to demonstrate the benefits of robotic surgery over other approaches in the treatment of rectal cancer12 and have shown even potentially worse outcomes in procedures for cervical cancer.4 Observational studies that compared robotic surgery with more established laparoscopic or open approaches have also failed to demonstrate superior outcomes after inguinal hernia repair,8 kidney resections,1 colectomy,13-16 or cholecystectomy.7 The discrepancy between the ongoing rapid adoption of robotic surgery and unclear clinical benefit highlights why accurate information on how it is being applied in contemporary surgical practice is necessary.  This study expands on prior work in several ways. We used manually abstracted data from a  statewide surgical registry to ensure that our estimates reflect the true incidence of robotic surgery across a wide range of procedures, hospitals, and surgeons. Making further use of these unique data, we estimated how the initiation of robotic surgery within hospitals had broad associations with surgical practice for numerous procedures that differed in complexity, anatomical location, and surgical indications (eg, repair of a hernia vs removal of an organ). This investigation builds on existing literature, which has shown similar associations of an increase in robotic prostatectomy with  Table 3.

For many common and low-risk procedures, such as cholecystectomy, conventional laparoscopic surgery is already the accepted standard of care. Laparoscopic approaches are also less expensive and can be performed by most general surgeons without robotics.18 This situation highlights a questionable trend: robotic surgery is replacing conventional laparoscopic approaches for procedures that may not be complex enough to warrant the consideration of an advanced, expensive, and unproven minimally invasive platform. This study suggests that regulators and the surgical community can take additional steps to  monitor the ongoing diffusion of robotic surgery and ensure that this trend does not lead to diminished patient safety. Because accurate data are necessary to inform the creation of appropriate safeguards, the FDA and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services should consider providing coverage for robotic surgery with provisions for evidence development.19 This process has been previously used by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services to create registries of patients treated with new and unproven surgical technologies (eg, carotid artery stenting). Use of these provisions would facilitate greater understanding of how robotic procedures are being used in real- world practice. Akin to postmarket surveillance of pharmaceuticals, such provisions would also create a common data resource from which the comparative safety and effectiveness of robotic operations can be evaluated by numerous investigators.  This action would also allow hospitals, which provide credentials to perform robotic surgery, to  better understand where sufficient evidence suggests plausible benefit. At present, surgeons are largely able to use robotic surgery for any procedure at their professional discretion. As has been shown in the FDA warning and through prior studies, this discretionary use may place patients at risk for poor outcomes.3 Facilitating transparency around the allocation of robotic surgery would allow patients to make better collaborative decisions with their surgeons. After all, for many of the procedures we report in this study, little to no evidence suggests that robotic surgery increases patient safety or treatment effectiveness compared with other approaches.  Limitations Our results should be interpreted within the context of several limitations. Our clinical registry only captures data from Michigan and therefore may not be generalizable to the country as a whole. However, the MSQC represents a heterogeneous group of hospitals, surgeons, and practice settings. Furthermore, we report on the most common general surgery procedures performed in the United States. Changes in patient factors, such as obesity, may influence trends in procedure choice. Our estimates may therefore be limited by a lack of adjustment for patient characteristics. That said, adjusting for patient factors may introduce its own biases because no clinical consensus exists around how robotic procedures should be allocated. Much of this decision-making is based on case- by-case surgeon assessments and clinical nuance not captured in any registry. Our results are consistent across multiple different procedures, which also suggests that these trends are independent of unique clinical domains or disease processes. Our study is unable to account for how other nonclinical factors, such as marketing, may influence the adoption of robotic surgery. However, others have found that the chances of receiving robotic surgery were 2- to 5-fold greater in highly competitive vs noncompetitive health care markets.20 Moreover, evidence suggests that hospitals immediately begin advertising their acquisition of robotic surgical services through web-based and conventional health system marketing campaigns.21 These data are complementary to ours and suggest that the greatest forces driving robotic surgery adoption may be the technological imperative and economic pressures experienced by hospitals in certain health care markets.  Conclusions This study found that robotic surgery is rapidly diffusing across a broad range of common general surgical procedures. Trends toward greater use of the robotic platform appeared to occur rapidly  JAMA Network Open. 2020;3(1):e1918911. doi:10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2019.18911  (Reprinted)  January 10, 2020  7/9  Downloaded From: https://jamanetwork.com/ on 02/06/2023JAMA Network Open | Surgery  Trends in the Adoption of Robotic Surgery for Common Surgical Procedures  after hospitals begin performing robotic surgery and were associated with a decrease in the use of established minimally invasive techniques, such as laparoscopic surgery. This trend was consistent across numerous specific procedures, even those for which conventional laparoscopic surgery is already considered standard of care and for which robotic surgery offers little theoretical clinical benefit to the patient. These findings highlight a need to continually monitor the diffusion of robotic surgery to ensure that enthusiasm for a new technology does not outpace the evidence needed to use it in the most effective clinical contexts.

Bestle, RN; James Desemone, MD; Steven C. Stain, MD  Hypothesis: Postoperative hyperglycemia is an inde- pendent risk factor for postoperative surgical site infec- tion (SSI).  Design: Retrospective medical record review.  Setting: Academic tertiary referral center.  Patients: A total of 2090 general and vascular surgery patients in an institutional quality improvement data- base between November 1, 2006, and April 30, 2009.  Main Outcome Measure: Postoperative SSI.  Results: Postoperative glucose levels were available for 1561 patients (74.7.0%), of which 803 (51.4%) were ob- tained within 12 hours of surgery. The significant uni- variate predictors of SSI in general surgery patients were increasing age, emergency status, American Society of An- esthesiologists physical status classes P3 to P5, opera- tive time, more than 2 U of red blood cells transfused, preoperative glucose level higher than 180 mg/dL (to con- vert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0555), diabe- tes mellitus, and postoperative hyperglycemia. On mul-  tivariate adjustment, increasing age, emergency status, American Society of Anesthesiologists classes P3 to P5, operative time, and diabetes remained significant pre- dictors of SSI for general surgery patients. After adjust- ment for postoperative glucose level, all these variables ceased to be significant predictors of SSI; only incremen- tal postoperative glucose level remained significant. Sub- analysis revealed that a serum glucose level higher than 140 mg/dL was the only significant predictor of SSI (odds ratio, 3.2; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.4-7.2) for co- lorectal surgery patients. Vascular surgery patients were 1.8 times (95% CI, 1.3-2.5 times) more likely to de- velop SSI than were general surgery patients. Operative time and diabetes mellitus were the only significant uni- variate predictors of SSI among vascular surgery pa- tients, and postoperative hyperglycemia was not associ- ated with SSI.  Conclusions: Postoperative hyperglycemia may be the most important risk factor for SSI. Aggressive early post- operative glycemic control should reduce the incidence of SSI.  Arch Surg. 2010;145(9):858-864  P OSTOPERATIVE SURGICAL SITE  infection (SSI) is a well- known cause of morbidity in the United States.1,2 It is the third most common nosoco- mial infection, and it accounts for 14% to 17% of all hospital-acquired infections.1,3 In surgery patients, SSI is the most com- mon nosocomial infection (38%).2,4,5 Stud- ies4,6-8 have shown that these infections prolong the hospital length of stay after surgery, increase rehospitalization rates, and dramatically increase the use of emer- gency services and health care costs.  See Invited Critique  at end of article  It has been well established that pa- tients with diabetes mellitus are more prone to surgical and other nosocomial infec-  tions.9-11 Although the mechanism by which diabetes predisposes to SSI is not well understood, hyperglycemia has been pro- posed as a causative factor for the higher infection rates in diabetic patients.11 Hyper- glycemia has also been shown to be asso- ciated with increased morbidity and mor- tality rates in nondiabetic patients.12,13  Intensive insulin therapy is common in cardiac and surgical intensive care units (ICUs), often with the goal of maintain- ing capillary glucose levels between 80 and 110 mg/dL (to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0555). This improved glycemic control during the first 48 hours after surgery has been shown to reduce SSIs in cardiovascular surgery and surgical ICU patients.14-16 This reduction in SSIs seems to be independent of preoperative glyce- mic control. The benefit of glycemic con- trol has been shown to be stronger and more consistent in diabetic patients.11  Author Affiliations: Departments of Surgery (Drs Ata and Stain), Quality Management (Ms Bestle), and Internal Medicine (Dr Desemone), Albany Medical College (Ms Lee), Albany, New York.

METHODS  Data for this study were abstracted from the ACS-NSQIP da- tabase.18 Albany Medical Center, Albany, New York, is a 630- bed tertiary care hospital that participates in the ACS-NSQIP. The program provides participating hospitals with data for the purposes of quality improvement. The study sample included data from patients who underwent general or vascular surgery at Albany Medical Center between November 1, 2006, and April 30, 2009. The details of the ACS-NSQIP sampling methods, data abstraction process, and variables collected have been de- scribed elsewhere.18,19 Briefly, the program collects data on pre- operative risk factors, intraoperative variables, and 30-day post- operative mortality and morbidity outcomes for patients undergoing major surgical procedures. Data are collected and uploaded electronically to the ACS-NSQIP database by each site’s surgical clinical reviewer using a variety of methods, includ- ing medical record abstraction. The sampling strategy re- quires hospitals to report their first 40 consecutive eligible cases on an 8-day cycle. Each subsequent cycle starts on a different day of the week to capture a variety of cases and surgeons and to minimize bias in case selection. General and vascular sur- gery patients were identified using the surgical subspecialty vari- able. In general surgery, colorectal surgery patients were iden- tified using the following Current Procedural Terminology codes: 44140, 44141, 44143 to 44147, 44150 to 44153, 44155, 44156, 44160, 44204 to 44208, 44210 to 44212, 44239, 45110 to 45116, 45119 to 45121, 45123, 45395, 45397, 45499, and 45550. Co- lorectal procedures were open or laparoscopic and included par- tial or complete removal of the colon or rectum. This study was limited to patients 16 years or older at the time of admission. The ACS-NSQIP does not require collection of information on the preoperative, intraoperative, or postoperative blood glu- cose level or its management. Therefore, information on pre- operative and postoperative blood glucose levels was ab- stracted via medical record review by a medical student ( J.L.) and a research nurse (S.L.B.). After data were abstracted from the ACS-NSQIP database, they were supplemented with infor- mation on postoperative serum glucose levels and the time of blood sample collection in the 48 hours after surgery.  The study sample was a randomized selection of noncolo- rectal general surgery and vascular surgery patients from all avail- able patients (n=3129) during the previously mentioned pe- riod. Colorectal surgery patients were oversampled for statistical precision. Data from 2090 randomly selected patients were ab- stracted and were supplemented with postoperative glucose in- formation from medical records. The study sample included all colorectal surgery patients from the specified period. Post- operative serum glucose information was available for 1561 pa- tients (74.7%), of which 803 (51.4%) were obtained within 12 hours of the end of surgery. Postoperative glucose values were determined for 776 noncolorectal general surgery patients, 559 vascular surgery patients, and 226 colorectal surgery patients. Postoperative infection was the primary outcome of inter- est and was defined as a postoperative occurrence of a super- ficial, deep incisional or organ space SSI. Dependent variables  were selected based on a previous analysis of data from 129 000 patients in the 2005-2006 ACS-NSQIP participant user data file. The risk factors and potential confounders assessed for this study included age at hospital admission (16-40, 41-60, or ⬎60 years), sex, race/ethnicity (white, black, Hispanic, other, or un- known), diabetes mellitus, emergency vs elective surgery, the most recent preoperative serum glucose level within 3 months of surgery, the patient’s preoperative status as indicated by the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status clas- sification (P1 through P5 indicating none to mild systemic dis- ease through life-threatening to moribund systemic disease) and the number of red blood cell (RBC) units given intraopera- tively (ⱕ2 or ⬎2 U), operative time, and first postoperative se- rum glucose level. Preoperative serum glucose levels were avail- able within 7 days of the operation date for 90% of the study population.  Risk factors were determined separately for general and vas- cular surgery patients. A subanalysis of general surgery patients to determine risk factors for colorectal surgery patients was also conducted. For bivariate analysis, t tests and simple logistic re- gression were used to estimate and compare the unadjusted risk of infection across exposure categories. Variables significant at the .20 level were fitted into the multiple logistic regression model. Variables significant at the .05 level were retained in the final models. For risk of SSI associated with operative time, intraop- erative time risk was estimated using odds ratios for every 10- minute increase in operative time. If postoperative glucose level was found to be significant during bivariate analysis, a multi- variate model that excluded adjustment for postoperative se- rum glucose level was determined first. Postoperative glucose level was then added to the model to assess whether the vari- ables exerted their effect on SSI via postoperative serum glucose level. Separate analyses were conducted for general (n=1002) and vascular (n=559) surgery patients. A subanalysis of 226 co- lorectal surgery patients in the general surgery group was also conducted. The effects of the significant risk factors on postop- erative serum glucose levels were also determined separately via bivariate analysis of risk factors and postoperative serum glu- cose levels, with the latter as the dependent variable dichoto- mized at a cutoff value of 140 mg/dL.  RESULTS  The overall SSI rate in the study sample was 7.42%. In- fection rates were significantly higher for colorectal (14.11%) and vascular (10.32%) surgery patients than for noncolorectal general surgery patients (4.36%) (P ⬍.001 for both). Colorectal surgery patients were 3.6 times (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.3-5.7 times) and vascular surgery patients were 2.5 times (1.7-3.7 times) more likely to develop an SSI than were noncolorectal general surgery patients.  GENERAL SURGERY  Bivariate analysis revealed that compared with patients with a first postoperative glucose level of 110 mg/dL or less, the likelihood of getting an SSI increased progres- sively for patients with higher serum glucose levels (Table 1). The incidence of SSI ranged from 1.8% in the 110 mg/dL or less category to 17.7% in the greater than 220 mg/dL category (Table 1). The likelihood in- creased from 3.61 times (95% CI, 1.22-10.67 times) in patients with a first postoperative serum glucose level in the 111 to 140 mg/dL range to 12.13 times (3.71-39.64  (REPRINTED) ARCH SURG/ VOL 145 (NO. 9), SEP 2010  WWW.ARCHSURG.COM  859  ©2010 American Medical Association.

Increasing age, higher ASA class, emergency surgery, diabetes, more than 2 U of intraoperative RBCs trans- fused, preoperative serum glucose level higher than 180 mg/dL, and increasing operative time were the other sig- nificant unadjusted risk factors for SSI (Table 1). The risk did not vary significantly by race or sex.  A multivariate model that included all the significant variables except postoperative serum glucose level re- vealed that intraoperative RBC transfusion and pre- operative serum glucose level were not independent predictors of SSI. Patients with ASA classes P4 and P5 (life-threatening to moribund systemic disease) but not class P3 (severe systemic disease) were significantly more likely than were those with ASA classes P1 and P2 (none to mild systemic disease) to acquire a postoperative SSI (Table 1). The adjusted odds ratios for all the signifi- cant risk factors were similar to but slightly lower than the unadjusted odds ratios.  After adjustment for postoperative serum glucose level in the previous multivariate model, all the risk factors ceased to be significant predictors of SSI. Postoperative  glucose level was, therefore, the single most important risk factor for SSI in general surgery patients. The effect of postoperative glucose level on SSI in general surgery patients was, therefore, the same as the unadjusted effect (Table 1).  COLORECTAL SURGERY  Subanalysis of colorectal surgery patients in the general surgery group revealed that a postoperative serum glu- cose level higher than 140 mg/dL was the only signifi- cant predictor of SSI for colorectal surgery patients. The incidence of infection in colorectal surgery patients with postoperative serum glucose levels higher than 140 mg/dL (20.6%) was 3.2 times (95% CI, 1.4-7.2 times) that of those with serum glucose levels of 140 mg/dL or less (7.6%).

Without accounting for postoperative glucose level, the risk factors and their respective effects were similar to those reported in earlier studies by other authors and our own analysis of a larger multihospital ACS-NSQIP data set.17,21 However, after accounting for postoperative se- rum glucose level, all the risk factors ceased to be sig- nificant predictors of SSI. For general surgery patients, we assessed the association of each risk factor with post- operative glucose level in a separate crude bivariate analy- sis. The analysis shows that all the independent risk fac- tors for SSI, before adjusting for postoperative serum glucose level (Table 1), were associated with an in- creased likelihood of postoperative serum glucose lev- els (Table 3). For colorectal surgery patients, postop- erative serum glucose level was the only significant risk factor in bivariate and multivariate analyses. This might be owing to the few colorectal surgery patients in this study. Vascular surgery patients were more than 2 times more likely to develop an SSI compared with noncolo- rectal general surgery patients and 1.8 times (95% con- fidence interval, 1.3-2.5 times) more likely compared with all general surgery patients. The likelihood of SSI in vas- cular surgery patients was unaffected by the same risk factors as for general surgery patients, including post- operative serum glucose level. The likelihood of infec- tion was positively associated with operative time in vas- cular and general surgery patients (Figure).  In a landmark study in 2001, van den Berghe et al22 showed that aggressive treatment of postoperative hyper- glycemia in the surgical ICU significantly reduced rates of infection, morbidity and mortality, and 1-year survival.

Effect of operative time on the likelihood of surgical site infection (SSI) in all general surgery patients (n=2059) and vascular surgery patients (n=1070).  cardiac population or post–cardiac surgery infections be- cause up to a quarter of the patients undergoing cardiac surgery have diabetes, and postoperative infections in this subpopulation are associated with high mortality rates as well.14-16,23 A retrospective study24 of diabetic patients who had cardiac surgery showed that increased mean glucose levels for the first 2 days after surgery was an independent risk factor for deep sternal wound infection. The same group25 showed in a prospective study of 2467 diabetic pa- tients undergoing cardiac surgery that postoperative hyperglycemia was associated with deep sternal wound infection. An indirect association was demonstrated by showing that tight glycemic control via a continuous in- sulin infusion leads to a 66% reduction in deep sternal wound infections.25 A prospective study13 of nondiabetic cardiac patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery also demonstrated an increased incidence of mediastinitis in nondiabetic patients with postoperative hyperglycemia. The present study confirms the previous findings in noncardiac general surgery patients. In a sub- analysis of nondiabetic patients, we found increasing post- operative glucose levels to be significantly associated with the risk of SSI, and the dose-response relationship was also similar.  Although the American Diabetes Association and the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists rec- ommend maintaining random serum glucose values of 180 mg/dL or less in the perioperative period for all non- cardiovascular surgical procedures, there is less evi- dence supporting the association between hyperglyce- mia and SSI after noncardiac operations or in non-ICU patients.26 A recent meta-analysis27 of 5 randomized con- trolled trials found insufficient evidence to support strict glycemic control (glucose level ⬍200 mg/dL) over con- ventional management for the prevention of SSI. Most studies of general surgery patients have had small sample sizes, resulting in inconclusive results, and few studies have specifically examined the relationship between the level of hyperglycemia and SSI in general surgery pa- tients.28-31 In a prospective randomized study, Grey and Perdrizet32 reported a reduction in nosocomial infec- tions in general surgery ICU patients using strict glyce-  mic control. With the finding of relatively higher mor- tality in the group with a blood glucose target of 81 to 108 mg/dL in the NICE-SUGAR (Normoglycemia in In- tensive Care Evaluation–Survival Using Glucose Algo- rithm Regulation) trial, the benefits of strict glycemic con- trol remain controversial.33 The study, however, focused on medical and surgical ICU patients.  In a retrospective study of patients undergoing in- frainguinal vascular surgery, Vriesendorp et al30 found that postoperative hyperglycemia was associated with in- creased postoperative infections. The association weak- ened in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus after cor- recting for postoperative glucose level.30 The same authors29 found conflicting results in another retrospec- tive study of 151 ASA class P1 and P2 patients undergo- ing esophagectomy. They found no associations among postoperative glucose level, insulin administration, and infection. A randomized trial28 of the effect of intensive insulin therapy on the infection rate in 78 patients un- dergoing intracerebral aneurysm clipping after subarach- noid hemorrhage showed reduced infection rates in the intensive therapy arm. In a study of 100 diabetic pa- tients undergoing elective abdominal or cardiac sur- gery, Pomposelli et al31 demonstrated that the infection rates were more than 2 times higher in hyperglycemic patients compared with those with postoperative serum glucose values less than 220 mg/dL. A recent study34 of diabetic colorectal surgery patients found that serum glu- cose levels higher than 200 mg/dL in the initial 48 hours after surgery were independently associated with in- creased SSI rates.  In the present study, the disappearance of the effect of all the risk factors on SSI after adjusting for postop- erative glucose level suggests that the effect of other risk factors may be exerted via alteration of serum glucose levels. Although we may speculate that hyperglycemia may be the cause of the increased SSI rate, it is also pos- sible that the accumulation of the other well established SSI risk factors lead to hyperglycemia. Treating hyper- glycemia, therefore, might not necessarily reduce the risk of SSI. However, it is commonly accepted that hypergly- cemia affects the immune system via impaired chemo- taxis, phagocytosis, and the production of reactive oxy- gen species.35 There is also evidence that insulin itself has anabolic, anti-inflammatory, anticoagulant, and anti- apoptotic activities.36-38  The present treatment algorithm for patients with post- operatively identified hyperglycemia is to begin basal in- sulin glargine (Lantus; Sanofi-Aventis US, Bridgewater, New Jersey) therapy once daily or basal neutral prot- amine Hagedorn every 12 hours at a dose of 0.2 to 0.3 U/kg/d rounded to the nearest unit subcutaneously. Glargine is a long-acting basal insulin analogue with a longer duration of action (approximately 24 hours) than NPH (approximately 18 hours). Postoperatively, capil- lary blood glucose measurements are obtained every 6 hours, and the dose of basal insulin (or insulin ana- logue) is adjusted to achieve glucose levels that are con- sistently less than 180 mg/dL. The use of “sliding scale insulin” (or “rapid-acting insulin analogues”) is discour- aged. This study shows that the SSI rates for general sur- gery patients increase dramatically to 10% at postopera-  (REPRINTED) ARCH SURG/ VOL 145 (NO. 9), SEP 2010  WWW.ARCHSURG.COM  862  ©2010 American Medical Association.

In colorectal surgery patients, 140 mg/dL was also the cut- off value for increased SSI rates. Based on the results of this study, a revised protocol targeted at achieving glu- cose levels less than 140 mg/dL will be considered for a future prospective study.  This study was limited by the fact that the patients were from a single hospital, and the results, therefore, need to be verified by larger, prospective, multiple-hospital stud- ies. Also, the first postoperative serum glucose value was available within 12 hours for only 51.3% of the study popu- lation and within 24 hours for 96.0% of the patients. The results should, therefore, be interpreted with caution.  In conclusion, we found postoperative hyperglyce- mia to be the most important independent risk factor for SSI in general and colorectal surgery patients, and se- rum glucose levels higher than 110 mg/dL were associ- ated with increasingly higher rates of postsurgical infec- tion. If hyperglycemia is confirmed in future prospective studies with better postoperative glucose data to be an independent risk factor for postsurgical infection in gen- eral surgery patients, this would give surgeons a modi- fiable variable to reduce the incidence of postoperative infection.

Role of Hyperglycemia in SSIs  INVITED CRITIQUE  Postoperative Hyperglycemia and SSI in General Surgery Patients  D iabetes mellitus has been thought to represent  a risk factor for several types of surgical com- plications, as well as SSI, but is perceived to be beyond our control. The article by Ata et al dispels the notion that diabetes gives us risk we cannot manage and adds to the recent literature1 that suggests that hyper- glycemia is the issue to be controlled to reduce SSI rates. However, various shortcomings need to be ad- dressed as the science of understanding and controlling SSI proceeds. First, this article shows an association, not causation, between postoperative hyperglycemia and SSI. Striking is the failure to find the association in vascular surgery patients, who presumably have the highest rates of diabetes and had higher rates of SSI than did general and colorectal surgery patients. This leads one to won- der whether factors such as hemoglobin A1C level, nu- trition, tobacco use, obesity, operative time, and tissue perfusion/oxygenation may be more powerful factors in the equation. Efforts are also under way to culture post- operative infections to understand whether current pro- phylaxis is inadequate for today’s bacteria.  Being a retrospective study using data extracted from the ACS-NSQIP database leads to other weaknesses in the data. Only 74.7% of patients had any postoperative glucose data, and only 51.4% of those were obtained in the first 12 hours. Much of these data came from the following morning’s routine laboratory tests, thus there is quite a variance as to when glucose monitoring began, how it was performed, and when, or even if, attempts at glycemic control began. Although diabetic patients were more likely than nondiabetic patients to develop an SSI in vascular patients, it may have been this lack of uniformity in postoperative care that led to the inability to correlate infection with postoperative hyperglycemia.  This work supports 3 important conclusions. First, postoperative hyperglycemia is not benign and is inde- pendently associated with SSI in general and colorectal surgery patients. With a better study design, such con- clusions will likely be shown in vascular surgery pa- tients as well. Second, this relationship is linearly re- lated to infection such that the higher the postoperative glucose level, the higher the infection risk. Third, a glu- cose level less than 140 mg/dL is the threshold that should be achieved to minimize the risk of SSI. These 3 prin- ciples will form the foundation for future work in this area. This group’s work also stimulates us to consider tech- niques with more effective glycemic control, such as the liberal use of insulin glargine.  Succeeding work will need to focus on preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative glucose control; tech- niques for glucose management; and in which patients such efforts are necessary. Of course, this is one of a myriad of factors that we as surgeons can investigate to reduce SSI rates. Inspiring leaders such as Dr Stain and col- leagues are to be congratulated for showing that sur- geons can be the drivers for surgical quality improve- ment on an individual and system level.
